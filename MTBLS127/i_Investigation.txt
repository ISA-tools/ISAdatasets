Study Identifier	"MTBLS127"
Study Title	"Resveratrol metabolism in HepG2 (human hepatocytes), HaCaT (human keratinocytes), and C2C12 (mouse myoblasts)"
Study Description	"Resveratrol (RESV) is a plant polyphenol, which is thought to have beneficial metabolic effects in laboratory animals as well as in humans. Following oral administration, RESV is immediately catabolized, resulting in low bioavailability. This study compared RESV metabolites and their tissue distribution after oral uptake and skin absorption. Metabolomic analysis of various mouse tissues revealed that RESV can be absorbed and metabolized through skin. We detected sulfated and glucuronidated RESV metabolites, as well as dihydroresveratrol. These metabolites are thought to have lower pharmacological activity than RESV. Similar quantities of most RESV metabolites were observed 4 h after oral or skin administration, except that glucuronidated RESV metabolites were more abundant in skin after topical RESV application than after oral administration. This result is consistent with our finding of glucuronidated RESV metabolites in cultured skin cells. RESV applied to mouse ears significantly suppressed inflammation in the TPA inflammation model. The skin absorption route could be a complementary, potent way to achieve therapeutic effects with RESV. </p> Cells were treated with 0, 20 or 200 µM RESV for 4 h. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed, and metabolites were extracted and analyzed by LC-MS. Peak areas metabolites were normalized by peak areas of spiked internal standards (10 nmol 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and piperazine-N,N’-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES). 3 samples for each condition (except for HaCaT 200 µM, 2 samples)."

Study Protocol Description	"Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine with some modifications as follows; DMEM (1.0 g/l glucose) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) for HepG2; DMEM (4.5 g/l glucose) with 10% FCS for HaCaT; DMEM (4.5 g/l glucose) with 20% FCS for C2C12. C2C12 cells were differentiated into myotubes by switching medium into DMEM containing 2% horse serum. Cells were plated on a 10 cm dish and allowed to adhere for 18 h. Cells were treated with 20 or 200 µM RESV. After 4 h incubation, cells were washed with PBS twice, followed by addition of 2 ml 50% ice-cold methanol. Collected cells were transferred into tubes on ice for further processing."	"After addition of internal standards (10 nmol HEPES and PIPES) to metabolome samples and brief vortexing, samples were transferred to Amicon Ultra 10 kDa cut-off filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove proteins. Following sample concentration by vacuum evaporation, each sample was resuspended in 40 µl 50% acetonitrile and 1 µl was used for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis."	"LC-MS data were obtained using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), as described previously [1]. Briefly, metabolites were separated on a ZIC-pHILIC column (Merck SeQuant, Sweden; 150 x 2.1 mm, 5 µm particle size) using acetonitrile (A) and 10 mM ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 9.3 (B) as the mobile phase, with gradient elution from 80% A to 20% A in 30 min, at a flow rate of 100 µl/min. Sample injection volume was 1 µl per run.

Each sample was analyzed twice, once in negative and once in positive ionization mode."	"Peak areas of metabolites of interest, within the raw LC-MS data, were measured using the MZmine 2.10 software and normalized using the peak areas of HEPES and PIPES. The complete workflow and processing parameters are summarized in the publication."	"Metabolites were identified by comparing their m/z values and retention times with authentic pure standards. If no standard was available, metabolites were assigned by analysis of MS/MS spectra (MS/MS), as described in the publication. In cases where no standard compound or MS/MS spectrum was available, compounds were identified by generating chemical formulae using m/z values in MZmine 2.10 module and given MS status."
