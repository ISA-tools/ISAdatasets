Study Title	"Collagen induced arthritis in dba/1j mice associates with oxylipin changes in plasma"
Study Description	"Oxylipins play important roles in various biological processes and are considered as mediators of inflammation for a wide range of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The purpose of this research was to study differences in oxylipin levels between a widely used collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice model and healthy control (Ctrl) mice. DBA/1J male mice (age: 6-7 weeks) were selected and randomly divided into two groups, viz. a CIA- and a Ctrl group. The CIA mice were injected intraperitoneal (i.p.) with the joint cartilage component collagen type II (CII) and an adjuvant injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Oxylipin metabolites were extracted from plasma for each individual sample using solid phase extraction (SPE) and were detected with high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS), using dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM). Both univariate and multivariate statistical analysis was applied. The results in univariate student's t-test revealed 10 significantly up- or down-regulated oxylipins in CIA mice, which were supplemented by another 6 additional oxylipins, contributing to group clustering upon multivariate analysis. The dysregulation of these oxylipins revealed the presence of ROS-generated oxylipins and an increase of inflammation in CIA mice. The results also suggested that the Collagen-induced arthritis might associate with dysregulation of apoptosis, possibly inhibited by activated NF- κ B because of insufficient PPAR-γ ligands."

Study Protocol Description	"20 DBA/1J male mice (6–7 weeks; Charles River Laboratories) were randomly divided in 2 groups (10 in CIA group, 10 in Ctrl group as healthy control). In the CIA group, immunization with collagen type II will provoke chronic polyarthritis by the induced autoimmune response. Each mouse was intraperitoneal induced (i.p.) with joint cartilage component collagen type II (CII; 100 µg diluted with a 100 µl volume 0.005 M acetic acid) which was extracted from bovine nasal cartilage (Funakoshi Co., Tokyo, Japan) at day 0 (T=0). Thereafter, the CII injection was repeated i.p. on days 14, 28, 42 and 56. In the ctrl mice, 100 µl of 0.005 M acetic acid alone was administered i.p. on the same days (0, 14, 28, 42 and 56).
</p>
Next, to all experimental mice, 5 mg of Lipopolysaccharide from E. coli 011:B4 (Chondrex, Redmond, USA) dissolved in 100 µl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was given i.p. immediately after each injection of CII. In the ctrl group, 100 µl PBS was similarly administered as a control. All animals were maintained in a temperature and light controlled environment with free access to standard rodent chow and water. From day 71 to day 75, blood was taken from each animal of both groups and collected in pre-cooled tubes containing EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) as co-agulant (BD Vacutainer, Plymouth, UK). After centrifugation at 3000 x g for 10 min, the EDTA-plasma was collected and aliquots were stored at -80 ºC until further processing. 50 µl aliquot of mouse plasma was used for the oxylipins study."	"Antioxidant mixture (5 µl) (0.4 mg/ml BHT and 0.4 mg/ml EDTA mixed with volume ratio 1:1) and a mixture of internal-standard mixtures (ISTDs) (5 µl, 1000 nM) were added into each 50 µl aliquot of mouse plasma. Subsequently the samples were loaded on the activated SPE plates (Oasis-HLB 96-well plates, 60 mg, 30 µm) and eluted using ethyl acetate (1.5 ml). The dried eluate was re-dissolved in 50 µl acetonitrile/methanol (50:50 v/v) and 5 µl were used for HPLC analysis."	"Separation was done by HPLC (Agilent 1290, San Jose, CA, USA) using an Ascentis Express C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 2.7 µm particles; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) with 0.35 ml flow during 28 min gradient."	"The HPLC was coupled to electrospray ionization on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent 6490, San Jose, CA, USA). Oxylipins were detected in negative ion mode using dynamic Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)."	"Peak areas were exported from Mass Hunter software (Agilent Technologies, version B.05.01) and ratios to internal standards were computed (target compounds/ ISTDs). Subsequently, an in-house developed QC tool was used to correct for instrument drift and batch effects. The reliability of the measurements was assessed by calculating the reproducibility of each metabolite in a QC pool, which was measured after every 10 samples. 30 unique oxylipins out of a target list of 110 oxylipins included in the metabolomics platform met the criteria RSD-QC <35% and were included in the final list for the further statistical analysis. Data were log transformed (Glog) and scaled by the standard deviation (auto-scaling) in order to get a normal distribution."	"MRM transitions were achieved by flow injection of pure standards and the optimizer application and were compared to literature. Then the MRM transitions were used for identification of each compound."
