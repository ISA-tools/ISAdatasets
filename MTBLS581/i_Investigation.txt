Study Identifier	"MTBLS581"
Study Title	"Comparative metabolomic responses to gibberellic acid and 6-benzylaminopurine in Cunila menthoides Benth. (Lamiaceae): a contribution to understand the metabolic pathways."
Study Description	"Little is known about the effects of 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) on the synthesis of secondary metabolites in species of Lamiaceae. In this study, for the first time, the profile of secondary metabolites in plantlets of Cunila menthoides was characterized, using UPLC-ESI-Qq-oaTOF-MS. Ninety metabolites were identified, including polyphenols and terpenes. BA down-regulated most of the identified molecules in relation to GA3 and MS0 (control). The results showed that GA3 elicited synthesis of many phenols from different classes, and seemed to play a major role in the shikimate pathway in relation to BA. GA3 enhanced production of sesquiterpenoids, polyterpenoids, steroids and monoterpenoids compared to MS0 and BA, and also seemed to positively influence the MEP/DOXP and MVA pathways. These data show the most comprehensive metabolomic profile of Cunila menthoides to date, and the effects of BA and GA3 on the synthesis of secondary metabolites, modulating quantitative aspects of metabolism in Lamiaceae."

Study Protocol Description	"Seeds belonging to the personal collection of Prof. Dr. Gustavo Agostini were donated to this project. Seeds of C. menthoides were collected in several different locations in southern Brazil, with geographical coordinates previously reported[1]. Representative samples were identified botanically and duly filed, cataloged and recorded in the Herbarium-accredited ICN (ICN 183282) located at the Institute of Biosciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)[2].

The following solutions were prepared: (A) chloroform and methanol (1:2, v/v), and (B) aqueous potassium chloride (1%, v/v). Frozen material (1 g) from each treatment was separately and finely macerated with liquid nitrogen, then vortex-mixed with 3 ml of solution (A). After centrifugation (14,000 x g, 10 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was removed and the pellet was vortex-mixed with 3 ml of solution (A) plus 0.8 ml of solution (B). After centrifugation (14,000 x g, 10 min, 4 °C), supernatants from this and the previous step were combined and diluted with 2 ml of chloroform plus 1.2 ml of solution (B). The 2 layers formed corresponded to hydrophilic (HE) at bottom, and lipophilic (LE) on top, extracts. Aliquots of 1 ml of each extract phase were transferred to centrifuge tubes and then dried with a rotary vacuum concentrator. All extraction steps included protection from light. Samples were stored at –80 °C in an ultrafreezer until preparation for UPLC-ESI-Qq-oaTOF-MS acquisition.

PMID:13671378</br>"	"UPLC-ESI-Qq-oaTOF-MS analysis was carried out using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC system coupled to a Xevo G2-S QTof (Waters Corp.) hybrid quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer. A HSS T3 C18 1.8 µm 1.0 x 100 mm (Waters) reverse phase coulumn was used or metabolite separation. The mobile phase (A) consisted of 0.3% formic acid in ultra-pure water containing 5 mM ammonium formate, and the mobile phase (B) consisted of 0.3% formic acid in acetonitrile. The gradient method followed the steps: 97% A and 3% B at 0 min; 50% A and 50% B at 11.8 min; 15% A and 85% B at 12.38–13.53 min and equilibration with 97% A and 3% B from 14.11 to 16.99 min. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min and the column was maintained at 35 °C. The injection volume of each sample was 2 µl. Each batch of samples was randomized and injected in triplicate."	"The mass data were acquired by the Xevo G2-S QTof (Waters Corp.) mass spectrometer in negative electrospray ion mode ESI (–) set to 2.0 kV, the cone voltage set to 2.0 kV, the cone gas set to 50 l/hr, and the source temperature set to 120 °C. The desolvation gas was high-purity nitrogen flowing at 600 l/hr at a temperature of 450 °C. The optic mode was resolution. The scan range selected was from m/z 50 to 1000. Data were collected in the centroid mode with lock-mass correction “on-the- fly”. MassLynx V4.1 software was used for instrument control and acquisition. Data were acquired in MS E mode, where the collision energy was alternated between low energy (2 V) and high energy (15–55 eV). Leucine-enkephalin, C28 H37 N5 O7, ([M–H]– = 554.2615 m/z) at a concentration of 0.4 ng/l in acetonitrile and water (50:50, v/v) with 0.1% (v/v) of formic acid, and flow rate of 20 µl/min was chosen as lock-mass reference for the negative ion mode. Lock-mass scan time was set to 0.3 s, with intervals of 15 s and 3 scans to average with a mass window of ± 0.3 Da."	"The RAW data files were imported into Progenesis QI for Metabolomics v2.1 (Nonlinear Dynamics) for processing and analyzing the mass data information."	"For compound identification, analytical standards and the database platforms KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), LipidMAPS (http://www.lipidmaps.org/) and PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) were used. Database sets were constructed prioritizing terpenes and phenolic compounds, and the identification was performed using the following parameters: precursor mass error = 5 ppm and fragment tolerance = 10 ppm. Non-targeted selection parameters were established as: Anova (p) = 0.5, coefficient of variation (CV) < 0.3, score > 30, fragmentation score > 30 and isotope similarity > 80. We considered as identified only the compounds that were present in at least 2 of the 3 technical replicates. Adducts considered for analysis were [M-H2O-H]–, [M-H]–, [M+Cl]– and [M+FA-H]–. Other parameters such as fragmentation score and literature record of the occurrence of the molecules in plant species were also included, for disambiguation. Also for disambiguation and synonym-solving, the following platforms were consulted: FooDB (http://foodb.ca/), HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/), Chemspider (http://www.chemspider.com/), Metlin (https://metlin.scripps.edu/index.php) and NIST Chemistry Webbook InChIKey search (http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/inchi-ser.html). Metabolites with different abundances were considered up-regulated and strongly up-regulated when log2 of the total ion abundance was 2.0 or greater and 7.0 or greater, respectively, and down-regulated and strongly down-regulated when log2 was –2.0 or less and –7.0 or less, respectively."
