Study Title	"Characterization of trotter horses urine metabolome by means of proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy"
Study Description	"BACKGROUND: Metabolomics has been recognized as a powerful approach for disease screening. In order to highlight potential health issues in subjects, a key factor is the possibility to compare quantitatively the metabolome of their biofluids with reference values from healthy individuals. Such efforts towards the systematic characterization of the metabolome of biofluids in perfect health conditions, far from concluded for humans, have barely begun on horses. </br> OBJECTIVES: The present work attempts, for the first time, to give reference quantitative values for the molecules mostly represented in the urine metabolome of horses at rest and under light training, as observable by 1H-NMR. </br> METHODS: The metabolome of ten trotter horses, four male and six female, ranging from 3 to 8 years of age, has been observed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy before and after three training sessions. </br> RESULTS: We could characterize and quantify 54 molecules in trotter horse urine, originated from diet, protein digestion, energy generation or gut-microbial co-metabolism. </br> CONCLUSION: We were able to describe how gender, age and exercise affected their concentration, by means of a two steps protocol based on univariate and robust principal component analysis."

Study Protocol Description	"10 Standardbred horses, 6 females and 4 males, body condition score (BCS) 2.8–3.0 out of 5[1], aged between 3 and 8 years (median 6.5 years), were enrolled in the present study. The weight of the horses ranged between 405 and 511 Kg (median 479 Kg). All horses had the same fitness level and were regularly trained from at least 6 months prior the beginning of the trial. Once enrolled, the horses were stabled in individual boxes and were administered a standardized diet composed by hay (a mix of ryegrass and wild oats) and complementary feed (containing a mix of oats, barley, wheat and alfalfa pellets). The diet remained unchanged throughout the year. Horses enrolled in the study did not have access to pasture during the experimental period. The daily exercise schedule consisted of standardized progressive work sessions of walk and trot. All the horses included in the study received no drug and showed no clinical sign of disease (dyspnea, anorexia/disorexia, weight loss, nasal discharge, cough, fever, diarrhea, lameness) throughout the 3 months prior to the sampling period and throughout the study.
</p>
3 urine samples per animal were collected in different moments of the year (listed in Table 1 in the paper associated with this study) by means of a stick connected with a sterile 50 ml Falcon tube containing NaN3, placed under the urine flow at the time of urination. Urine was frozen at − 80 °C within 2 h after collection.

"Urine samples were prepared for NMR by thawing and centrifuging them for 15 min at 18,630 x g at 4 °C. An amount of supernatant equal to 350 μl was added to 350 μl of bi-distilled water and to 200 μl of a D2O solution of 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid (TSP) sodium salt 10 mM, buffered at pH 7.00 ± 0.02 by means of 1 M phosphate buffer.  After centrifugation, the samples were placed in an NMR tube of 5 mm of diameter."	"1H-NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K with an AVANCE III spectrometer (Bruker, Milan, Italy), at a frequency of 600.13 MHz, equipped with Topspin software (Ver. 3.5)."	"As published previously[1], the signals from broad resonances were suppressed by a CPMG-filter composed by 400 echoes with a tau of 400 μs and a 180° pulse of 24 μs, for a total filter of 330 ms. The HOD residual signal was suppressed by means of presaturation. This was done by employing the cpmgpr1d sequence.

PMID:29566085</br>"	"Topspin software was used to apply a line broadening of 0.3 Hz and to adjust the phase of each spectrum, while R computational language[1] was employed for any further spectra processing, molecules quantification and data mining step, by means of scripts developed in house. The spectra were aligned towards TSP signal (-0.017 ppm). The baseline of each spectrum was then adjusted by means of peak detection according to the “rolling ball” principle[2] implemented in the “baseline” R package[3]. We finally applied a linear correction to each spectrum.
