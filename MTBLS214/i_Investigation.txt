Study Identifier	"MTBLS214"
Study Title	"Global Metabonomic and Proteomic Analysis of Human Conjunctival Epithelial Cells (IOBA-NHC) in Response to Hyperosmotic Stress"
Study Description	"“Dry eye” is a multi-factorial inflammatory disease affecting the ocular surface. Tear hyperosmolarity in dry eye contributes to inflammation and cell damage. Recent research efforts on dry eye have been directed towards biomarker discovery for diagnosis, response to treatment and disease mechanisms. This study employed a spontaneously immortalized normal human conjunctival cell line, IOBA-NHC as a model to investigate hyperosmotic stress-induced changes of metabolites and proteins. Global and targeted metabonomic analyses, as well as proteomic analysis were performed on IOBA-NHC cells incubated in serum-free media at 280 mOsm (control), 380 mOsm and 480 mOsm for 24 h. Twenty-one metabolites and seventy-six iTRAQ-identified proteins showed significant changes under at least one hyperosmotic stress treatment as compared to controls. SWATH-based proteomic analysis further confirmed the involvement of inflammatory pathways such as prostaglandin 2 synthesis in IOBA-NHC cells under hyperosmotic stress. This study is the first to identify glycerophosphocholine synthesis and O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine glycosylation as key activated pathways in ocular surface cells under hyperosmotic stress. These findings extend the current knowledge in metabolite markers of dry eye and provide potential therapeutic targets for its treatment."

Study Protocol Description	"The nontransfected, spontaneously immortalized normal human conjunctival epithelial (IOBA-NHC) cells were maintained in a modified medium consisting of 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Ham’s F 12 culture media (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 ng/ml of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 1 µg/ml of bovine insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 µg/ml of cholera toxin, (Sigma Aldrich), 0.5 µg/ml of hydrocortisone and 1 x strength of broad spectrum antibiotic antimycotic (Invitrogen).
</p>
Cells for all experiments were treated using the same procedure. Each set consisted of three sub-cultures grown to 80% confluence and adapted to Keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM) (Invitrogen) overnight. Treatment media were applied to cells in each set and they were incubated in parallel for 24 h. The treatment conditions were as follows: control – unadjusted KFSM media at 277 mOsm/l, T1 and T2 – KFSM media adjusted to 377 mOsm/l 477 and mOsm/l respectively. 
</p>
Each hyperosmotic medium was prepared by the addition of 2 M NaCl prepared in PBS to commercial KFSM. Osmolarity measurements were performed using a vapour pressure osmometer (Vapro, Wescor Inc)."	"5 sets of cells were grown in 6-well plates and treated with control, T1 and T2 treatment media. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS (4 °C) and lysed by the addition of 1.5 ml of methanol maintained at -80 °C. Plates were scraped over a dry ice bath, and each lysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. Lysates were vortex-mixed at 1200 rpm for 5 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 x g (4 °C). The supernatants were concentrated in a vacuum concentrator and freeze-dried subsequently."	"Analysis was performed on a Prominence UFLC system (Shimadzu) coupled to a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex). A Waters T3 C18 2.1 x 100 mm, 3 µm column (Waters) was used for separation. Each sample was reconstituted in 50 µl of water and 10 µl was injected for each analysis in positive and negative ionization mode. The mobile phase for positive ionization mode was 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water (eluent A) and 0.1% FA in acetonitrile (eluent B). The gradient profile was 2% B from 0 to 2 min, 15% B at 8 min, 50% B at 14 min, 90% B from 18 to 20.5 min, and 2% B from 21 to 27 min. The mobile phase for negative ionization mode was 5 mM ammonium formate and 0.05% FA in water (eluent A) and 5 mM ammonium formate and 0.05% FA in 9:1 acetonitrile/water (eluent B). The gradient profile was 2% B from 0 to 2 min, 15% B at 8 min, 50% B at 14 min, 100% B from 18 to 20.5 min, and 2% B from 21 to 27 min. The flow rate in both chromatographic methods was 0.3 ml/min."	"Acquisition of MS/MS spectra in both ionization modes was controlled by the information-dependent-acquisition (IDA) function of the Analyst TF software (AB Sciex). One TOF MS survey scan (150 ms) was followed by 25 MS/MS scans (50 ms each). The mass range TOF-MS and MS/MS were 50–1000 and 25–1000 m/z respectively. The following parameters were applied: dynamic background subtraction, charge monitoring to exclude multiply charged ions and isotopes, and dynamic exclusion of former target ions for 5 s. Collision energy (CE) was ramped from 20–30V in MS/MS scans."	"MarkerView (AB Sciex) was used for peak detection and alignment of raw chromatographic data obtained from acquisition in positive and negative ionization mode respectively. One peak table comprising the mass to charge ratio (m/z), retention time (RT) and integrated peak area of detected peaks in the analyzed samples was generated for each ionization mode. The following peak classes were excluded from subsequent analysis: i) peaks attributed to isotopes, ii) peaks with an average area that were less than 3 times the average area in blank injections and iii) peaks with a coefficient of variation greater than 80% among replicates. The samples in each peak table were normalized to their respective 90th percentile peak area sums."	"The m/z values of each marker peak were queried in the METLIN metabolite database25 to obtain its putative metabolite identifications. For this step, the batch search mode was adopted, with mass accuracy set to 12 ppm. The following adducts were applied to the m/z values of marker peaks obtained via positive ionization mode: [M+H]+, [M+NH4]+ [M+Na]+, [M+K]+, [M-H2O+H]+. Similarly, [M-H]-, [M-H2O-H]-, [M+Cl]-, [M+FA-H]- were applied to m/z values obtained via the negative ionization mode. Metabolite identities were confirmed by retrieval of experimental MS/MS spectra and comparison with the respective entries in METLIN or MassBank spectra databases. Selected metabolites were verified with standards. Unresolved metabolites with the same molecular formula were reported as mixtures."
