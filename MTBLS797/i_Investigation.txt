STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS797"
Study Title	"Bluebell saponins: Application of metabolomics and molecular networking"
Study Description	"Bulb, leaf, scape and flower samples of British bluebells (<i>Hyacinthoides non-scripta</i>) were collected regularly for one growth period. Methanolic extracts of freeze-dried and ground samples showed antitrypanosomal activity, giving more than 50% inhibition, for 20 out of 41 samples. High-resolution mass spectrometry was used in the dereplication of the methanolic extracts of the different plant parts. The results revealed differences in the chemical profile with bulb samples being distinctly different from all aerial parts. High molecular weight metabolites were more abundant in the flowers, shoots and leaves compared to smaller molecular weight ones in the bulbs. The anti-trypanosomal activity of the extracts was linked to the accumulation of high molecular weight compounds, which were matched with saponin glycosides, while triterpenoids and steroids occurred in the inactive extracts. Dereplication studies were employed to identify the significant metabolites via chemotaxonomic filters and considering their previously reported bioactivities."

Study Protocol Description	"Bluebell plants used in this study were collected under licence (Grid Reference SH 257 359). Soil and above ground plant material were taken using a stainless steel square hollow section (dimensions 20 cm by 20 cm and 30 cm depth). Bluebell plants were removed from this soil sample and separated into different tissue types (bulbs, leaves, scapes, shoots and flowers). The tissue types were combined, freeze-dried (CHRIST Alpha 1-2 LD plus) and ground using pestle and mortar. Each sample contained approximately 20 individual plants. The first sample was taken in March 2014 of plants with an emerged shoot. The end of the plant’s life occurred in July followed by the subterranean phase (during the end of July-October). On 3 occasions, samples from the time of shoot emergence and re-growth in the following growth period were also taken to account for 1 full growth period."	"Freeze-dried and powdered plant tissues (100 mg) were extracted with MeOH on a 10 mg dry weight to 1 ml of solvent ratio. The samples were shaken at 250 rpm for 30 min. After this period, the samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 5000 rpm, the clear supernatant was separated and the solvent was evaporated. Aliquots of 1 mg of the dried extracts were transferred into LC vials for the subsequent metabolomics profiling analysis.
"	"HPLC analysis was carried out using DionexUltiMate 3000-Thermo Scientific. Dried plant extracts (1 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml HPLC-grade MeOH. The samples were eluted through a C-18 column (ACE, 75 mm, id 3.0 mm, particle size 5 μm). The mobile phase used 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). The flow rate was 300 µl/min. Gradient elution was employed, commencing at 10% B, held for 5 min, increased to 100% B over 30 min, held for another 5 min before decreasing back to 10% B, held for 4 min. Solvent blank refers to sample containing solvent only which was run for the purpose of subtracting background spectra."	"<div>Mass spectrometry was carried out using an Exactive mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source over a mass range of 100-2000 m/z in positive and negative ionization modes with spray voltage of 4.5 kV and capillary temperature at 270 °C.

The capillary temperature was 270 °C, the ion spray voltage was 4.5 kV, the capillary voltage 35 V, the tube lens voltage 110 V and the sheath and auxiliary gas flow rates were 50 and 15, respectively (units not specified by manufacturer).
</div>"	"<div>Mass spectral data was processed using the MZmine 2.20 freeware (http://mzmine.sourceforge.net/)[1]. Throughout the data processing, the m/z tolerance used was 0.001, peaks were detected above 5.00e^4 and the minimum time span and tR tolerance was 0.2 min. Mass detection was performed using centroid mass detector with a noise level set at 1.00e^4. The peaks were filtered using FTMS shoulder peaks filter with a mass resolution of 50,000 and the Gaussian peak model.</div><div><br></div><div>Ref: <br></div><div>[1] Macintyre L, Zhang T, Viegelmann C, Martinez IJ, Cheng C, Dowdells C, Abdelmohsen UR, Gernert C, Hentschel U, Edrada-Ebel R.

Formula prediction was accomplished using the element count heuristic rules[1] and double bond equivalence restrictions (RDBE) with the enabled isotope pattern filter. The processed positive and negative raw data were then converted to CSV files and imported into an in-house macro written in Excel[2]. Peaks with intensities 20 times greater in the samples than in the blank solvent were retained. Through EXCEL, macros were also run to match the m/z peaks with the DNP database version 2015[33] to enable dereplication of the ion peaks at a m/z threshold of ±3 ppm, which provided a list of known and unknown metabolites according to their peak intensity. This data was exported to SIMCA V 15.0 (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden) and further analysed using both PCA and OPLS-DA with Pareto scaling.</div><div><br></div><div>LC-MS/MS data were subjected to a molecular networking analysis at Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking website.
