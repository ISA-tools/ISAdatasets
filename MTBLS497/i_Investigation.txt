Study Title	"Headspace volatile organic compounds from bacteria implicated in ventilator-associated pneumonia analysed by TD-GC/MS."
Study Description	"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a healthcare-acquired infection arising from the invasion of the lower respiratory tract by opportunistic pathogens in ventilated patients. The current method of diagnosis requires the culture of an airway sample such as bronchoalveolar lavage, which is invasive to obtain and may take up to seven days to identify a causal pathogen, or indeed rule out infection. While awaiting results, patients are administered empirical antibiotics; risks of this approach include lack of effect on the causal pathogen, contribution to the development of antibiotic resistance and downstream effects such as increased length of intensive care stay, cost, morbidity and mortality. Specific biomarkers which could identify causal pathogens in a timely manner are needed as they would allow judicious use of the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis in exhaled breath is proposed as an alternative due to its non-invasive nature and its potential to provide rapid diagnosis at the patient's bedside. VOCs in exhaled breath originate from exogenous, endogenous, as well as microbial sources. To identify potential markers, VAP-associated pathogens Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were cultured in both artificial sputum medium and nutrient broth, and their headspaces were sampled and analysed for VOCs. Previously reported volatile markers were identified in this study, including indole and 1-undecene, alongside compounds that are novel to this investigation, cyclopentanone and 1-hexanol. We further investigated media components (substrates) to identify those that are essential for indole and cyclopentanone production, with potential implications for understanding microbial metabolism in the lung."

Study Protocol Description	"Media preparation:</br>
Nutrient agar (NA) (Oxoid, Basingstone, UK), nutrient broth (NB) (Oxoid), and artificial sputum medium (ASM) were utilised in this study. NA and NB were prepared according to manufacturer's specification. Details for preparing ASM have been published previously[1]. Briefly for ASM, type II mucin (Sigma-Aldrich, UK), salmon sperm DNA (Sigma-Aldrich, UK), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, UK), sodium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, UK), potassium chloride (Fisher scientific, UK), Tris base (Formedium, Hunstanton, England), egg yolk emulsion (Oxoid, UK), casamino acids (BD, Sparks, USA) were all dissolved in distilled water and subsequently autoclaved. MOre information has been published previously[2]. M9 minimal medium was also used to grow Escherichia coli strains. Briefly, the minimal medium is a mixture of four solutions: glucose (5 g; Sigma Aldrich, UK) dissolved in 50 ml distilled water (DW); ammonium chloride (1 g; Fisher Scientific, UK) and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (0.5 g; AnalaR, UK) dissolved in 800 ml DW; disodium phosphate (3 g; Fluka, Switzerland) and monopotassium phosphate (3 g; Sigma Aldrich, USA) in 150 ml DW, and Iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate (0.1 g; Sigma Aldrich, UK) and calcium chloride anhydrous solution (0.1 g; Fisher Scientific, UK) dissolved in 100 ml DW. 1 ml of the latter solution was added to the combined mixture of the other solutions before they were autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min and combined.
</p>
Bacterial culture:</br>
Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13887, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 were used in this study since these bacteria are most commonly associated with VAP[3]. Strains were recovered from glycerol frozen stocks, sub-cultured twice on NA plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C to obtain axenic colonies. Single colonies were subsequently transferred into 50 ml liquid media (ASM, NB) in 250 ml conical flasks sealed with sponges and incubated at 37 °C with 200 rounds per min (rpm) shaking.
</p>
Bacterial culture headspace sampling 
The headspace (200 ml) above liquid cultures was actively sampled onto Tenax GR thermal desorption tubes at a flow rate of approximately 100 ml/min using an Easy-VOC pump (Markes international, Llantrisant, UK) after incubation at time points that were determined based on culture growth curves as follows: E. coli NB (3, 5, and 15 h), E. coli ASM (10, 12 and 24 h), K. pneumoniae NB (5, 7, and 15 h), P. aeruginosa NB (3, 5, and 15 h), P. aeruginosa ASM (5, 7, and 12 h), S. aureus NB (3, 5, and 15 h), S. aureus ASM (4.5, 6.25, and 15 h). These time points reflect approximately 50%, 75%, and 100% of respective maximum ODs where the cultures had entered the stationary phase. Samples were collected under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood. All experiments were performed within a week with a minimum of 5 replicates for each condition and time point.

"VOC analysis was conducted on a thermal desorption-gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC-TOF-MS) platform (Unity II TD with UltrA autosampler, Markes International, and Micromass GCT Premier, Waters Corp, Manchester, UK). Prior to desorption, 100 μl of an internal standard (IS) (1 ppmV 4-bromofluorobenzene in N2; Thames Restek, Bucks, UK) was loaded onto each tube. This compound was used as an IS due to exhibiting similar chemical properties and vapour pressure to the analytes of interest and also being not naturally found in the samples as as recommended in EPA method TO-17[1]; we also use this in our clinical studies as described previously[2]. VOCs were desorbed from sorbent tubes at 280 °C for 5 min, cryo-focussed on a cold trap maintained at 10 °C and desorbed from the cold trap onto the GC (Agilent 6890N) column by flash heating to 280 °C for 3 min with a flow path temperature of 200 °C. The GC column (DB-5MS column, 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter (I.D), 0.25 μm film thickness, Agilent) was held at an initial temperature of 40 °C, ramped to 170 °C at 6 °C/min and to 190 °C at 15°C/min. A post run ramp to 250 °C was held for 2 min. The GC runtime was 23 min with a total TD cycle time of 40 min.

All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.3.2; R Core Team, 2016). The xcms package was used to pre-process the netCDF files in R following the approach as outlined previously[1]. Isotopologue parameter optimisation (IPO) was used to obtain optimised parameters for pre-processing raw data[2]. IPO is an R package which reiteratively pre-processes a selected number of netCDF files using a specified range of parameters and outputs the recommended parameters. The product of raw data pre-processing is a data file containing ion fragments, their corresponding m/z, retention times, and integrated areas. Normalisation using the internal standard (IS), 4-bromofluorobenzene, was based on the 174 m/z parent ion.
