STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS169"
Study Title	"Metabolite Profiling of wildtype and overexpression Arabidopsis thaliana"
Study Description	"We use metabolite profiles of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana measured on an UPLC-ESI/QqTOF-MS to evaluate uni- and multivariate statistical analysis of redundant features in compound spectra. Comparison was performed between the wild-type Col-0 and the 90.32 mutant. The mutant is a transposon based activation tagged A. th. line from the TAMARA population Schneider et al. [2005]. This particular mutant has an over-expression of the AT5G55880 - AT5G55890 genetic region with unknown function."

Study Protocol Description	"Leaves were harvested and processed with a cryogrinding robot: Fill ~50% volume of the scintillation vials with frozen leaf material (leaves can be broken to fit in). Add 3 steel balls, diameter 5 mm. Use robot sample program Arabidopsis leaf. Weights: 100 mg weight, 2 mg tolerance."	"To the frozen leaf material 200 µl methanol/water, 80/20 (v/v) pre-cooled at –40 °C and spiked with biochanin A (5 µM, Sigma) as internal standard, the samples were immediately vortexed for 15 s. Probes were placed in ice to slowly warm up to ~0 °C. Then the probes were vortexed, sonicated for 15 min at 20 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 19000 /g. The supernatants were transferred to new 2 ml tubes and the remaining pellets subjected to a second extraction using 200 µl methanol/water, 80/20 (v/v). The combined extracts were evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge at 30 °C, reconstituted in 200 µl methanol/water, 30/70 (v/v), vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 19000 /g. The supernatants were transferred to glass vial for measurement."	"Chromatographic separations were performed on an Acquity UPLC system (Waters) equipped with a HSS T3 column (100 x 1.0 mm, particle size 1.8 µm, Waters, oven temperature 40 °C) applying the following binary gradient at a flow rate of 150 µl/min: 0-1 min, isocratic 95% A (water/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)), 5% B (acetonitrile/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)); 1-16 min, linear from 5 to 45% B; 16-18 min, isocratic 95% B; 18-20 min, isocratic 5% B. The injection volume was 3.0 µl (full loop injection)."	"Eluting compounds were detected from m/z 100-1000 using a micrOTOF-Q hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with an Apollo II electrospray ion source in positive and negative ion mode using following instrument settings: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 1.6 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 6 l/min, 190 °C; capillary, –4500 V; end plate offset, -500 V; funnel 1 RF, 200 V; funnel 2 RF, 200 V; in-source CID energy, 0 V; hexapole RF, 100 V; quadrupole ion energy, 5 eV; collision gas, nitrogen; collision energy, 7 eV; collision RF 150/350 V (timing 50/50); transfer time, 70 µs; pre pulse storage, 5 µs; pulser frequency, 10 kHz; spectra rate, 3 Hz. Mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode. Mass calibration of individual raw data files was performed on lithium formate cluster ions obtained by automatic infusion of 20 µl 10 mM lithium hydroxide in isopropanol/water/formic acid, 49.9/49.9/0.2 (v/v/v) at a gradient time of 18 min using a diverter valve."	"Raw data files were converted to mzData format using the vendor-specific CompassXport (http://www.bdal.de/)
with useRecalibratedSpectra=TRUE  and processed using the XCMS package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html). XCMS settings for processing LC/MS data were prefilter=3,100; snthr=6; ppm=30, peakwidth=5,12. For alignment group.density function with parameters mzwid=0.015, minfrac=1 and bw=3 was used."	"None."	"Perceval growth chamber, short day conditions - light: 9:00-17:00, temperature day/night  23/23 °C."
