Study Title	"Biodiversity in marine invertebrate responses to acute warming revealed by a comparative multi-omics approach"
Study Description	"Understanding species' responses to environmental change underpins our abilities to make predictions on future biodiversity under any range of scenarios. In spite of the huge biodiversity in most ecosystems, a model species approach is often taken in environmental studies. To date, we still do not know how many species we need to study to input into models and inform on ecosystem-level responses to change. In this study, we tested current paradigms on factors setting thermal limits by investigating the acute warming response of six Antarctic marine invertebrates: a crustacean Paraceradocus miersi, a brachiopod Liothyrella uva, two bivalve molluscs, Laternula elliptica, Aequiyoldia eightsii, a gastropod mollusc Marseniopsis mollis and an echinoderm Cucumaria georgiana. Each species was warmed at the rate of 1 °C / h and taken to the same physiological end point (just prior to heat coma). Their molecular responses were evaluated using complementary metabolomics (NMR-based metabolomics; LC-MS was also used for one of the sample types) and transcriptomics approaches with the aim of discovering the underlying mechanisms of their resilience or sensitivity to warming. The responses were species-specific; only two showed accumulation of anaerobic end products and three exhibited the classical heat shock response with expression of HSP70 transcripts. These diverse cellular measures did not directly correlate with resilience to heat stress and suggested that each species may have a different critical point of failure. Thus, one unifying molecular mechanism underpinning response to warming could not be assigned, and no overarching paradigm was supported. This biodiversity in response makes future ecosystems predictions extremely challenging, as we clearly need to develop a macrophysiology-type approach to cellular evaluations of the environmental stress response, studying a range of well-rationalized members from different community levels and of different phylogenetic origins rather than extrapolating from one or two arbitrary model species."

Study Protocol Description	"The animals were collected at Rothera Research Station, Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula (67o34'07"S, 68o07'30"W) during the austral summer at depths of 10-15 m. Animals were acclimated in the flow-through aquarium facility for 2 weeks prior to the experiment and the control animals (n=10 for each species) were maintained in the same system. The whole aquarium system was held in a controlled temperature room where air temperatures were set at 0.5 - 1.0 °C. Animals (n=10) were placed in 75 litre internal volume tanks with hollow walls, through which water was pumped from a temperature-controlled unit. The whole system was placed inside a temperature-controlled room and the system held at 0 ºC. After transfer of the animals to the experimental system, they were warmed at a rate of 1 °C/h. Immediately following the thermal treatment, the animals were measured (including where appropriate, length and height of shell) before being snap frozen in liquid nitrogen."	"Approximately 50 – 100 mg of frozen tissue were used for each extraction. Samples were homogenised in a Precellys bead-based homogeniser using ceramic beads. When the homogenates were removed from the Precellys tubes to clean 1.8 ml glass vials, an additional wash step was added. Instead of adding 4 µl/mg chloroform directly to the sample in the glass vials, 4 µl/mg chloroform and 2 µl/mg of double-distilled water were first added to the Precellys tubes and vortexed lightly before adding to the previous homogenate in the glass vials to ensure that all homogenised tissue was carried over for the next step. Both polar and non-polar fractions were removed into separate 1.8 ml glass vials using a Hamilton syringe and stored at -80 °C before further processing, although only the polar fraction was used for the following analyses. The polar metabolites were then transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Each metabolite sample was dried using a centrifugal concentrator and stored at -80 °C."	"The dried polar extracts were resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M in 10% D2O and 90% H2O, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mM sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3,-d4-propionate (TMSP: chemical shift standard)."	"The tissue extracts were analysed on the DRX-500 NMR spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a cryoprobe and operated at 500.18 MHz (at 300 K)."	"One-dimensional (1-D) 1H NMR spectra were obtained using excitation sculpting for water suppression and a 8.4 μs (60 °) pulse, 6 kHz spectral width and a 3 s relaxation delay with water presaturation. To maximise metabolite discrimination two-dimensional (2-D) 1H J-resolved (JRES) NMR spectra were also acquired for each sample using 8 transients per increment, for 32 increments, which were collected with spectral widths of 6 kHz in F2 (chemical shift axis) and 50 Hz in F1 (spin-spin coupling constant axis). A 4.0 s relaxation delay was employed resulting in a total acquisition time of 24 min."	"UHPLC-MS on a 100 mm x 2.1 mm Thermo Hypersil Gold column with a flow rate of 400 µl/min: The 15 min programme on the Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system contained a gradient from 100% A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 100% B (0.1% formic acid in methanol)."	"The LTQ-FT Ultra mass spectrometer acquired data in positive ion mode from m/z 100-1000 at 50,000 resolution and in centroid mode. To avoid salt contamination, the first 30 s of the LC run were diverted away from the mass spectrometer."	"NMR:</br>The JRES spectra were tilted by 45 °, symmetrised about F1 and calibrated using TopSpin (Bruker Biospin). The data were exported as the 1-D skyline projections of JRES spectra (pJRES) and converted to a format for multivariate analysis using custom-written ProMetab software in MATLAB. The 220 2-D JRES NMR spectra were processed and skyline-projection pJRES spectra were calculated in the Matlab programming environment using NMRlab software. The pJRES spectra were baseline corrected, unwanted spectral regions (containing TMSP, water and a signal between δH 2.21-2.26) were excluded, spectra were binned to a bin width of 0.005 ppm, normalised and g-log transformed using the lambda parameter 1e-7.</br>
