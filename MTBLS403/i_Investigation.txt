Study Title	"Characterization of white tea metabolome: comparison against green and black tea by a nontargeted metabolomics approach."
Study Description	"White tea is considered the least processed form of tea and is reported to have a series of potent bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, and anti-cancer activities. However, the chemical composition of white tea and the dynamic changes of the metabolites during the manufacturing process are far from clear. In this study, we applied a nontargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry to comprehensively profile the characteristic metabolites of white tea. There were significant differences in the content of amino acids, catechins, dimeric catechins, flavonol and flavone glycosides, and aroma precursors in white tea compared with green and black teas that were manufactured from the same fresh tea leaves. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of the metabolites in the tea samples with various withering durations of 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 36 h were also profiled. To the best of our knowledge, this study offers the most comprehensive characterization of the metabolites and their changes in white tea."

Study Protocol Description	"Clonal tea leaves of the “Fuding Dabaicha” variety (one bud with three leaves) were collected, and divided into 3 portions for the manufacturing of white, green, and black teas. The manufacturing process was as described below. For the sampling, one part of the tea sample was collected. The sampling was repeated six times for the manufactured teas (green, white, and black teas) and was repeated three times for the tea samples with various withering times (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 h).</br>
White tea:</br>
40 kg fresh tea leaves were withered at 30 ºC and a relative humidity of 47% for 36 h, and then dried at 120 ºC for 20 min and 80 ºC for 20-30 min to a moisture content of approximately 5%.</br>
Green tea:</br>
The manufacturing process of green tea was modified from a previous work. Briefly, after withering for 2 h, the tea leaves were fixed using a rotary continuous fixation machine to terminate the activities of the endogenous enzymes. Then, the leaves were rolled for 1 h before they were dried at 120 °C for 20 min and then at 80 °C for 20−30 min to a moisture content of approximately 5%.</br>
Black tea:</br>
The manufacturing process of black tea was modified from another previous work. After 12 h of withering at 30 ºC and a relative humidity of 47%, a roller was used to roll the tea leaves for 80 min. Then, the tea leaves were fermented at 30 °C with a relative humidity of 90% in an environment-controlled cabinet with a fermentation duration of 4 h, and then immediately dried to a moisture content of approximately 5% to terminate the fermentation using a hot air dryer at 120 °C for 20 min and then at 80 °C for 20−30 min.</br>
"	"Fifty milliliters of hot deionized water (100 °C) was added to 0.3 g ground tea powder (< 0.15 mm) and held at 100 °C for 5 min to extract the tea metabolome. Then, 1.6 ml of the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 x g (Centrifuge 5810R, Eppendorf) for 10 min. The supernatants were filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane and were then analyzed by LC–MS. Three internal standards of sulfacetamide, sulfafurazole, and flumequine (0.2 μg/ml) were spiked into the tea samples to evaluate the stability during the LC–MS process. In addition, quality control (QC) samples were prepared by mixing equal amount of each tea sample and were also used to evaluate the metabolomics process."	"An ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography system (UHPLC Infinity 1290, Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA) coupled to a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF 6540, Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA) was used for the initial LC-MS data acquisition. The chromatographic separation of the tea metabolome was conducted on a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm, Agilent Tech., Littlefalls, DE). The column was maintained at a constant temperature of 40 °C. Binary mobile phases were used for elution at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, where solvent A was an aqueous solution containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and solvent B was pure methanol. The linear gradient elution profile was as follows: 0 min, 10% B; 4 min, 15% B; 7 min, 25% B; 9 min, 32% B; 16 min, 40% B; 22 min, 55% B; 28 min, 95% B; and 30 min, 95% B. The total analysis time for one sample injection was 30 min. Four minutes were allowed for column equilibration between two consecutive injections. The injection volume was 3 μl."	"The effluent from the column was detected using a Q-TOF mass spectrometer with a dual jet stream ESI ionization source and operated in the positive mode. The major MS parameters were the same as previously reported. A mass scan range of 100–1100 m/z was applied for the full scan analysis. The Q-TOF/MS was calibrated daily following the manufacturer's procedure, and the reference ions with an m/z of 121.0509 (purine) and 922.0098 (hexakis phosphazine) were continuously infused via the reference sprayer during data acquisition for online calibration to ensure the MS accuracy."	"The raw data files acquired by LC-MS analysis were first processed by the DA Reprocessor software (Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA) to extract the metabolite feature ions, and then, the data were imported into the Mass Profiler Professional software (Version 13.0, Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA) for peak alignment. Ions with a relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 30% in the QC sample analyses were used for further univariate and multivariate statistics."	"The metabolites were identified according to authentic standards, accurate mass, MS2 spectra, metabolomics databases (Metlin and Human Metabolome Database), and previous work."
