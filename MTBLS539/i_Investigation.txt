Study Title	"Myocardial metabolic alterations in mice with diet-induced atherosclerosis: linking sulfur amino acid and lipid metabolism."
Study Description	"Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the effect of diet on the atherosclerotic heart's metabolism is unclear. We used an integrated metabolomics and lipidomics approach to evaluate metabolic perturbations in heart and serum from mice fed an atherogenic diet (AD) for 8, 16, and 25 weeks. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics revealed significant changes in sulfur amino acid (SAA) and lipid metabolism in heart from AD mice compared with heart from normal diet mice. Higher SAA levels in AD mice were quantitatively verified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Lipidomic profiling revealed that fatty acid and triglyceride (TG) levels in the AD group were altered depending on the degree of unsaturation. Additionally, levels of SCD1, SREBP-1, and PPARγ were reduced in AD mice after 25 weeks, while levels of reactive oxygen species were elevated. The results suggest that a long-term AD leads to SAA metabolism dysregulation and increased oxidative stress in the heart, causing SCD1 activity suppression and accumulation of toxic TGs with a low degree of unsaturation. These findings demonstrate that the SAA metabolic pathway is a promising therapeutic target for CVD treatment and that metabolomics can be used to investigate the metabolic signature of atherosclerosis."

Study Protocol Description	"5-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were housed 2 per cage under a constant temperature of 18–24 °C and a relative humidity of 50–60%. After a 7-day adaptation period, the mice were randomly divided into normal diet (ND) (n = 38) and atherogenic diet (AD) (n = 36) groups. Based on the AIN-76 diet, the AD was modified by the addition of 1.25% (w/w) cholesterol and 0.5% cholate (w/w)[1]. Table S2 in the paper associated with this study, lists the complete diet composition. All animals were allowed access to water and feed ad libitum. Body weight was measured once per week. After 8, 16, and 25 weeks of feeding, animals were fasted for 12 h and euthanized to collect sera and hearts, which were stored at −80 °C until use. At least 10 mice (n = 10–13) were included in each group. Heart weight was measured immediately after sacrifice. All studies were performed in accordance with the protocols for animal studies approved by the Committee on Animal Experimentation and Ethics of Korea University (KUIACUC-2013-236).

PMID:16373607</br>"	"To determine concentration of sulfur amino acids, previously used methods were modified and adopted[1][2]. In brief, to extract heart metabolites, 20 mg heart were transferred to each 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. 500 µl of 50% aqueous methanol (v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid were added and vigorously mixed for 30 s. Homogenization with 2.8 mm zirconium oxide beads was performed at 5000 rpm twice using a Precellys 24 tissue grinder (Bertin Technologies, France). 250 µl of chloroform was added to each sample tube and mixed for 30 s. After this, the sample solution was incubated at 4 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The solution under pellet was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube for lipidomic analysis of heart. Lipid extract of heart tissues was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, diluted with an isopropanol:acetonitrile:water mixture (2:1:1, v/v/v), and transferred into vials after centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 x g and 4 °C.

For heart tissues, 10-12 mg of each sample was transferred into a disposable insert tube. The residual space in the tube was filled with deuterium oxide (99.9 atom %D).

"LC separations were carried out on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (100 x 2.1 mm, particle size 1.7 µm, Waters, USA). Colum temperature and flow rate were set to 35 °C and 0.35 ml/min, respectively. The mobile phases used were 10 mM ammonium acetate in an acetonitrile:water mixture (40:60, v/v) (A) and acetonitrile:isopropanol mixture (10:90, v/v) (B). The linear gradients were as follows: 40–65% B for 5 min, 65-70% B for 7 min, 70-99% B for 3 min, 99% B for 2 min, 40% B for 3 min. The injection volume of the sample was 5 μl using partial loop mode for both positive and negative ionization polarity modes. Quality control (QC) samples, pooling identical aliquots of the samples, were measured regularly throughout the run for data reproducibility."	"To obtain MS spectral data, LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses of lipid extracts were performed on a triple TOF 5600 MS/MS System (AB Sciex, Canada) combined with a UPLC system (Waters, USA)."	"LC-MS/MS:</br>
The spectral data were analyzed by MarkerView (AB Sciex, Canada), which was used to find peaks, perform the alignment, and generate peak tables of m/z and retention times (min). Spectra were normalized to the median fold-change normalization. To identify reliable peaks and remove instrumental bias, peaks whose intensity in QC sample is lower than those in a blank sample were eliminated, and peaks with coefficients of variation below 20 in QC sample were selected.
</p>
1D-NMR and MAS-NMR:</br>
Free induction decays were weighted by an exponential function with a 0.3 Hz line-broadening factor prior to Fourier transformation. All acquired 1H NMR spectra were phase- and baseline-corrected using TopSpin 3.1 software (Bruker BioSpin, Germany) and Chenomx NMR Suite Version 7.1 (Chenomx, Canada). The chemical shift was referenced to the proton signals of lactate at 1.32 ppm and formate at 8.45 ppm. Resonance assignments for serum and heart metabolites were accomplished using the 800 MHz library of Chenomx NMR Suite Version 7.1 (Chenomx, Canada) and literature reports. A set of 2D NMR spectra (see Figs. S7-9 in the paper associated with this study) was acquired on some representative serum and heart samples and spiked experiments were performed to confirm the metabolite identities. Representative 800 MHz 1H NMR spectra of sera and 700 MHz HR- MAS 1H NMR spectra of heart tissues were shown in Figs. S10 and S11 in the paper associated with this study, respectively. The complete resonance assignment is listed in Table S3 in the paper associated with this study."	"LC-MS/MS:</br>
Lipids were tentatively identified by comparing the experimental data against various databases, including the METLIN (metlin.scripps.edu), Human Metabolome (www.hmdb.ca), MassBank (www.massbank.jp), and Lipid Maps (www.lipidmaps.org) databases. Fragment patterns (MS/MS spectra) were also used to identify lipid metabolites.
</p>
1D-NMR and MAS-NMR:</br>
Concentration of 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS) was estimated using ERETIC2 (Electronic Reference To access In vivo Concentrations) module in TopSpin software 3.1 (Bruker BioSpin, Germany), which is based on the PULCON principle (PULse Length based CONcentrations determination)[1][2]. Targeted metabolic profiling of serum and heart tissue were performed using Chenomx NMR Suite Version 7.1 (Chenomx, Canada) by integrating peak areas of metabolites compared with the areas of the DSS peak. For heart metabolites, tissue mass (g) was used to normalize metabolite levels.
