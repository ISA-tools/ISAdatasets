Study Title	"Dissolved organic matter produced by Thalassiosira pseudonana"
Study Description	"Phytoplankton are significant producers of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in marine ecosystems but the identity and dynamics of this DOM remain poorly constrained. Knowledge on the identity and dynamics of DOM are crucial for understanding the molecular-level reactions at the base of the global carbon cycle. Here we apply emerging analytical and computational tools from metabolomics to investigate the composition of DOM produced by the centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. We assessed both intracellular metabolites within T. pseudonana (the endo-metabolome) and extracellular metabolites released by T. pseudonana (the exo-metabolome). The intracellular metabolites had a more variable composition than the extracellular metabolites. We putatively identified novel compounds not previously associated with T. pseudonana as well as compounds that have previously been identified within T. pseudonana’s metabolic capacity (e.g. dimethylsulfoniopropionate and degradation products of chitin). The resulting information will provide the basis for future experiments to assess the impact of T. pseudonana on the composition of dissolved organic matter in marine environments."

Study Protocol Description	"The diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana (CCMP 1335) was cultured axenically in a modified version of L1 media with Turks Island Salts. The cultures were incubated under a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle. Cells were collected 6 h into the light cycle on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, and 10."	"The intracellular metabolites were extracted using a previously described method [1]. Briefly, 1.5 ml samples were centrifuged at 16,000 x g at 4 ºC for 30 minutes and the supernatant discarded. The resulting cell pellet was extracted three times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with 0.1 M ammonium hydroxide, dried in a vacufuge, and then re-dissolved in 1 ml of 90:10 (v/v) water:acetonitrile for analysis on the mass spectrometer.
</p>
Prior to sampling the extracellular metabolites, the cells were removed by gentle vacuum filtration through 0.2 µm Omnipore filters (hydrophilic PTFE membranes, Millipore). [2] have observed filtration may release intracellular metabolites into the exometabolome, and this potential bias must be considered in the discussion of our results. The acidified filtrate was extracted using solid phase extraction with PPL cartridges (Varian Bond Elut PPL cartridges) as previously described [3]. After eluting with methanol, the extracts were dried in a vacufuge, and then re-dissolved in 1 ml 90:10 water:acetonitrile prior to analysis.

Samples were stored at  20 ºC until mass spectrometric analysis. Analysis of the extracts was conducted within 48 hours of sample processing, except for the extracts from day three which were analyzed six days after sample processing. LC separation was performed on a Synergi Fusion reversed-phase column using a binary gradient with solvent A being water with 0.1% formic acid and solvent B being acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. Samples were eluted at 250 µl/min with the following gradient: hold at 5% B for 0-2 min, ramp from 5 to 65% B between 2 and 20 min, ramp from 65 to 100% B between 20 and 25 min, hold at 100% B from 25-32 min, and then ramp back to 5% B between 32 and 32.5 min for re-equilibration (32.5-40 min)."	"Both full MS and MS/MS data were collected. The MS scan was performed in the FT-ICR cell from m/z 100-1000 at 100,000 resolving power (defined at 400 m/z). In parallel to the FT acquisition, MS/MS scans were collected at nominal mass resolution in the ion trap from the two features with the highest peak intensities in each scan. Separate autosampler injections were made for analysis in positive and negative ion modes."	"Data were collected as XCalibur RAW files which were converted to mzXML files using the msConvert tool within ProteoWizard [1]. Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS [2], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm [3], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps. CAMERA was used 1) to find compounds differing by adduct ion and stable isotope composition [4] and 2) to extract the intensities and m/z values for the associated MS/MS spectra.

The databases included the Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD) [1], METLIN [2], and to a lesser extent MassBank [3], PubChem, and KEGG.
