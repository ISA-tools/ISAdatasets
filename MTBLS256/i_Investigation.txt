STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS256"
Study Title	"A Combined Metabolomic and Proteomic Investigation of the Effects of a Failure to Express Dystrophin in the Mouse Heart"
Study Description	"Muscle degeneration in the heart of 1-9 month-old mdx mice (a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy) has been monitored using metabolomic and proteomic approaches. In both data sets, a pronounced aging trend was detected in control and mdx mice, and this trend was separate from the disease process. In addition, the characteristic increase in taurine associated with dystrophic tissue is correlated with proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial metabolism."

Study Protocol Description	"All mice were maintained according to the UK Home Office guidelines. Male mice were removed from stable colonies of C57BL/10 control mice and mdx mice (n= 4 for each time point; 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 months old). Animals were killed by cervical dislocation, the heart rapidly removed and a 100 mg wet weight section of the left ventricle removed (typically within 15 s). Tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C prior to NMR and proteomic analysis. The genetic integrity of the colonies was monitored throughout by standard genotyping techniques."	"Frozen heart tissue was pulverized using a pestle and mortar, and metabolites were extracted using a chloroform/methanol extraction procedure (100 mg of wet weight tissue in 0.6 ml of 2:1 chloroform/methanol). To this, 0.2 ml of chloroform and water was added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 20 min at 13 000 rev/s."	"The resultant aqueous solution was lyophilised, and the extracts were redissolved in D2O containing 1 mM TSP for NMR analysis."	"All solution state spectra were acquired using a 9.6 T superconducting magnet interfaced to an INOVA spectrometer (Varian, CA, USA)."	"Solvent suppressed spectra were acquired into 16 K data points and summed over 128 scans, using a solvent suppression pulse sequence based on the start of the 1D NOESY pulse sequence (relaxation delay = 3 s; mixing time = 150 ms, t1 = 4 μs; solvent suppression during the mixing time and relaxation time)."	"Spectra were processed using ACD NMR manager software (ACD, Toronto, Canada). Free Induction Decays (FIDs) were Fourier transformed from the time to frequency domain following multiplication by a 1 Hz exponential function. Spectra were phased, baseline corrected, and referenced to the singlet of TSP at δ 0.0. Spectra were integrated across an average of 0.01 ppm integral regions between 0.2 and 9.72 ppm using an intelligent bucketing routine within ACD NMR manager."	"The output vector representing each spectrum was normalized across the integral regions, excluding the water resonance (4.5–5.2 ppm), effectively standardizing all the individual integrals to the total integral of all the low molecular weight metabolites. Metabolites were identified using reference to known standards, previous litterature and 2D NMR spectroscopy."
