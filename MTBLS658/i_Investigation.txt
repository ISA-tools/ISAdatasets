STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS658"
Study Title	"A robust intracellular metabolite extraction protocol for human neutrophil metabolic profiling"
Study Description	"BACKGROUND: Neutrophils are phagocytic innate immune cells that play essential roles in host defence, but are also implicated in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they contribute to systemic inflammation and joint damage. Transcriptomic analysis of neutrophils has revealed significant changes in gene expression in neutrophils activated in vitro by cytokines and in vivo during inflammation in RA. However, there are no reports on the global metabolomic changes that occur during neutrophil activation. The aim of this study was to establish protocols for the study changes in the metabolome of human neutrophils using 1H NMR spectroscopy."

Study Protocol Description	"Whole blood was collected into lithium-heparin vacutainers; the use of EDTA as an anticoagulant was avoided because extra resonance signals are observed in the NMR spectrum via the formation of complexes between EDTA and Ca2+ and Mg2+ present in plasma[1][2]. Neutrophils were isolated within 15 min of blood collection. Whole blood was mixed with HetaSep solution at a ratio of 1:5 (HetaSep:whole blood) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min until the plasma/erythrocyte interphase was at approximately 50% of the total volume. The erythrocyte-free phase containing all nucleated blood cells was collected, and carefully layered on top of Ficoll-Paque solution at a ratio of 1:1, and then centrifuged at 500 x g for 30 min. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) layer, plasma, and Ficoll-Paque solution, were carefully removed, leaving a neutrophil pellet (purity typically > 97%). The pellet was resuspended in RPMI-1640 media with 25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Remaining erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis with ammonium chloride buffer for 3 min, and then centrifuged at 400 x g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed, and neutrophils were re-suspended in RPMI-1640 with 25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4. To prepare cell pellets for metabolite extraction, neutrophils were centrifuged at 1,000 x g, at 25 ºC for 2 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and cell pellets were re-suspended with ice-cold PBS, then centrifuged at 1,000 x g, at 25 ºC for 2 min. The supernatant was discarded, while the pellets were heated at 100 °C for 1 min, and then were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at -80 °C prior to intracellular metabolite extraction.

Then samples were sonicated 3 times for 30 s at 23 kHz and 10 µm amplitude using an exponential probe, with 30 s rest between sonications in an ice water bath.  Sonicated samples were centrifuged at 12000 x g for 5 min at 4 ºC and the supernatant transferred to cryovials, flash frozen in liquid N2 and lyophilised."	"Each lyophilised sample was resuspended in 200 µl of 100 mM deuterated sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, with 100 µM d4 trimethylsilyl propionate (TSP) and 0.05% NaN3. Each sample was vortexed for 20 s and centrifuged at 12000 x g for 1 min at 20 ºC. 180 µl of each cell extract sample was transferred to 3 mm (outer diameter) NMR tubes for acquisition."	"1D 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance III HD 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TCI cryoprobe at pH 7.4 and 25 ºC."	"Samples were referenced to trimethylsilylpropanoic acid (TSP) at 0 ppm. Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software were used to identify metabolites and process spectra. Samples were analysed using the 1D Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (PMG) edited pulse sequence technique. Temperature was calibrated to 25 ºC (with margin of error of 0.1 ºC) via a methanol thermometer prior each day of acquisition and to maintain consistency, receiver gain was kept constant for all acquisitions. Spectra were automatically phased, referenced and baseline corrected in Topspin 3.1 (Bruker, UK)."	"Automated data processing, Fourier transformation, and phasing were carried out in Topspin v3.2 software using standard Bruker routines. The spectra were then normalised to TSP reference signal and bucketed per peak into a matrix of metabolite peak intensities using AMIX v3.9.14."	"Chenomx v8.2 software used for initial metabolite identification with manual confirmation to in-house standards for metabolite peaks found to be significantly variable. 
</p>
Statistical test:</br>
The prepared bucket table was subjected to univariate and multivariate analysis. Student T-test were applied on the spectra after determining the data were parametric using ggplot function in R. Unsupervised multivariate analysis of the spectra was carried after out using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The data was scaled by mean centering of each variable followed by division of the square root of the standard deviation (Pareto scaling) before analysis. The PCA reduced the 300 spectral buckets of each sample to X principal components (PCs) in cells, Y PCs in tumours and Z PCs in the combined analysis (explaining 95% or the variance in each analysis). The loadings of each PCA were analysed to identify the most influential buckets (and thus metabolites) responsible for the clustering observed."
