Study Identifier	"MTBLS46"
Study Title	"The cardiovascular risk of healthy individuals studied by NMR metabonomics of plasma samples."
Study Description	"The identification and the present wide acceptance of cardiovascular risk factors such as age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity have led to dramatic reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, novel risk predictors present opportunities to identify more patients at risk and to more accurately define the biochemical signature of that risk. In this paper, we present a comprehensive metabonomic analysis of 864 plasma samples from healthy volunteers, through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and multivariate statistical analysis (regression and classification). We have found that subjects that are classified as at high or at low risk using the common clinical markers can also be discriminated using NMR metabonomics. This discrimination is not only due to common markers (such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL), but also to (p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) other metabolites (e.g., 3-hydroxybutyrate, α-ketoglutarate, threonine, dimethylglycine) previously not associated with cardiovascular diseases."

Study Protocol Description	"The plasma samples for the NMR analysis were obtained from the backup aliquots of samples that, according to the SOPs, are stored in the Transfusion Service for analytical purposes for at least 24 h after blood withdrawal. The plasma samples were stored at -80 °C immediately after collection for further metabonomic analysis."	"Not applicable."	"Frozen plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and shaken before use. 300 µl of a phosphate sodium buffer (70 mM Na2HPO4; 20% v/v 2H2O; 0.025% v/v NaN3; 0.8% w/v sodium trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4]propionate (TSP); pH 7.4) were added to 300 µl of each plasma sample, and the mixture was homogenized by vortexing for 30 s. 450 µl of this mixture were transferred into a 4.25 mm NMR tube (Bruker BioSpin srl) for analysis."	"1H NMR spectra for all samples were acquired using a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) operating at 600.13 MHz proton Larmor frequency and equipped with a 5 mm CPTCI 1H-13C/31P-2H cryo-probe including a z axis gradient coil, an automatic tuning-matching (ATM) and an automatic sample changer. A BTO 2000 thermocouple served for temperature stabilization at the level of approximately 0.1 K at the sample. Before measurement, samples were kept for at least 3 min inside the NMR probehead, for temperature equilibration (310 K)."	"One-dimensional (1-D) spectra of plasma samples were acquired using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG; Bruker) spin-echo sequence to suppress signals arising from high molecular weight molecules, a standard pulse sequence(NOESYpresat), diffusion edited sequence using a diffusion time of 120 ms and fast two-dimensional (2-D) J-Resolved experiments (J-RES)."	"Free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential function equivalent to a 1.0 Hz line-broadening factor before applying Fourier transform. Transformed spectra were automatically corrected for phase and baseline distortions and calibrated (TMSP peak at 0.00 ppm) using TopSpin (Version 2.1, Bruker). Each 1-D spectrum in the range between 0.02 and 10.00 ppm was segmented into 0.02-ppm chemical shift bins, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using AMIX software (Bruker BioSpin). Regions between 6.0 and 4.5 ppm containing residual water were removed. The total spectral area was calculated on the remaining bins and normalization was carried out on the data prior to statistical analysis. The projection of each 2-D J-RES spectrum was segmented and processed as described below for the 1-D spectra."	"All resonances of interest were then manually checked, and signals were assigned on template one-dimensional NMR profiles by using matching routines of AMIX 7.3.2 (Bruker BioSpin) in combination with the BBIOREFCODE (Version 2-0-0; Bruker BioSpin) reference database and published literature when available."
