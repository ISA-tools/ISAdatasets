STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS261"
Study Title	"Metabolomics of the interaction between PPAR-alpha and age in the PPAR-alpha-null mouse (NMR assay)"
Study Description	"Regulation between the fed and fasted state in mammals is partially controlled by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha). Expression of the receptor is high in liver, heart and skeletal muscle, but decreases with age. A combined 1H NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS metabolomic approach has been used to examine metabolism in liver, heart, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in PPAR-alpha null mice and wild type controls during ageing between 3-13 months. For the PPAR-alpha-null mouse multivariate statistics highlighted hepatic steatosis, reductions in the concentrations of glucose and glycogen in both liver and muscle tissue, and profound changes in lipid metabolism in each tissue, reflecting known expression targets of the PPAR-alpha receptor. Hepatic glycogen and glucose also decreased with age for both genotypes. These findings indicate the development of age related hepatic steatosis in the PPAR-alpha-null mouse, with the normal metabolic changes associated with ageing exacerbating changes associated with genotype. Furthermore, the combined metabolomic and multivariate statistics approach provides a robust method for examining the interaction between age and genotype. </p> The GC-MS assay for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS314."

Study Protocol Description	"Tissues from wild type SVEV/129 mice, and PPAR-alpha-null mice were obtained from stable colonies at the University of Oxford (n=5; 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 months age). Mice were fed standard laboratory chow ad libitum prior to death (Special Diet Services, Essex, UK). Mice were injected subcutaneously with a 0.3 ml mixture of Medetomidine (10%; Pfizer Limited, Kent, UK), Ketamine (7.6%; Vétoquinol UK Limited, Bicester, UK) in sterile water and tissue collection was performed after the loss of corneal and pedal reflexes. Abdominal WAT, hearts, livers, skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius and soleus), and diaphragms were rapidly dissected (< 60 s post mortem time prior to freezing), frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ºC."	"Tissues were extracted using a methanol:chloroform:water extraction procedure to separate aqueous soluble metabolites from lipids as previously described [1]. Briefly, ~100 mg tissue were pulverised with dry ice. 600 µl methanol:chloroform (2:1) was added and the samples were sonicated for 15 min. Water and chloroform were added (200 µl of each) and the samples centrifuged for 20 min. The resulting aqueous and organic layers were separated from the protein pellet. The organic layer was dried overnight in a fume hood whilst the aqueous extracts were evaporated to dryness using an evacuated centrifuge (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).

Physiol Genomics 27: 178-186.</br>"	"The dried aqueous extracts were rehydrated in 600 µl D2O, buffered in 0.24 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM (sodium-3-(tri-methylsilyl)-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteriopropionate (TSP) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc., Andover, MA, USA) as an internal standard."	"The samples were analysed using an INOVA spectrometer operating at 400.13 MHz for the 1H frequency (Varian, CA, USA) using a 5 mm broadband inverse probe."	"Spectra were collected using a solvent suppression pulse sequence based on a one-dimensional NOESY pulse sequence to saturate the residual 1H water proton signal (relaxation delay=2 s, t1=3 µs, mixing time=150 ms, solvent presaturation applied during the relaxation time and the mixing time). In total, 128 transients were collected into 16K data points over a spectral width of 12 p.p.m. at 37 °C."	"NMR spectra were processed using ACD SpecManager 1D NMR processor (version 8, ACD, Toronto, Canada). Spectra were Fourier transformed following multiplication by a line broadening of 1 Hz, and referenced to TSP at 0.0 ppm. Spectra were phased and baseline corrected manually. Each spectrum was integrated using 0.04 ppm, integral regions between 0.5-4.5, and 5.1-10.0 ppm. To account for any difference in concentration between samples each spectral region was normalised to a total integral value of 10,000."	"Metabolites were identified using reference to known standards, previous litterature and 2D NMR spectroscopy."
