Study Title	"Organotypic microfluidic breast cancer model reveals starvation-induced spatial-temporal metabolic adaptations"
Study Description	"BACKGROUND: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the earliest stage of breast cancer. During DCIS, tumor cells remain inside the mammary duct, growing under a microenvironment characterized by hypoxia, nutrient starvation, and waste product accumulation; this harsh microenvironment promotes genomic instability and eventually cell invasion. However, there is a lack of biomarkers to predict what patients will transition to a more invasive tumor or how DCIS cells manage to survive in this harsh microenvironment. </br> METHODS: In this work, we have developed a microfluidic model that recapitulates the DCIS microenvironment. In the microdevice, a DCIS model cell line was grown inside a luminal mammary duct model, embedded in a 3D hydrogel with mammary fibroblasts. Cell behavior was monitored by confocal microscopy and optical metabolic imaging. Additionally, metabolite profile was studied by NMR whereas gene expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR. </br> FINDINGS: DCIS cell metabolism led to hypoxia and nutrient starvation; revealing an altered metabolism focused on glycolysis and other hypoxia-associated pathways. In response to this starvation and hypoxia, DCIS cells modified the expression of multiple genes, and a gradient of different metabolic phenotypes was observed across the mammary duct model. These genetic changes observed in the model were in good agreement with patient genomic profiles; identifying multiple compounds targeting the affected pathways. In this context, the hypoxia-activated prodrug tirapazamine selectively destroyed hypoxic DCIS cells. </br> INTERPRETATION: The results showed the capacity of the microfluidic model to mimic the DCIS structure, identifying multiple cellular adaptations to endure the hypoxia and nutrient starvation generated within the mammary duct. These findings may suggest new potential therapeutic directions to treat DCIS. In summary, given the lack of in vitro models to study DCIS, this microfluidic device holds great potential to find new DCIS predictors and therapies and translate them to the clinic."

Study Protocol Description	"The human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF10A) was obtained from ATCC (ATCC® CRL-10317™) and maintained with DMEM/F12 medium (Thermo Fisher, 11,320,033) supplemented with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Peprotech, AF-100-15), 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, H0888), 100 ng/ml Cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich, C9903), 10 μg/ ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, I6634) and 1% Pen/Strep (Thermo Fisher, 15,070,063) on regular tissue culture flasks. MCF10A-DCIS.com cells (will be referred as DCIS cells for simplicity) were developed by Miller et al. and distributed by Asterand (Detroit, MI, USA). They were generated from a MCF10AT clone initiated from a xenograft that evolved to DCIS lesions. DCIS cells were maintained in MCF10A medium.

100 μl of media were pooled from 12 microdevices. "	"Metabolites from cell media were harvested using a protein precipitation with methanol extraction procedure as described in [24]. Briefly, 100 μl of media was mixed at a 1:2 (v/v) ratio with methanol, vortexed, and incubated for 20 min at −20 °C. Media samples were then centrifuged at 11,093 x g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and dried using a Vacufuge Plus (Eppendorf).

PMID:24796490</br>"	"The concentrated metabolite samples were reconstituted in 600 μl of phosphate buffered deuterium oxide (D2O) solution. Phosphate buffered D2O solution (pH 7.2) was comprised of 0.1 M D2O (Acros Organics), 0.5 mM 3-trimethylsilyl-propionate-2, 2, 3, 3,-d4 (TMSP, δ = 0.0 ppm, internal standard) and 0.2% w/v sodium azide. Samples were centrifuged at 17968 x g for 10 min and 550 μl of supernatant was collected into 5 mm NMR tubes (Norell Inc.)."	"1H NMR metabolomic analysis of media samples was performed as described previously[1]. Media samples were analyzed using a 500 MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer with a 5 mm cryogenic probe at a temperature of 298 K at the National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison (NMRFAM).

Each spectrum consisted of 128 free induction decays (FIDs) and a spectral width of 12ppm. Line broadening (LB) of the FIDs was set to 0.5 Hz."	"Using Bruker Top-SpinTM software (version 3.2.5), the chemical shifts were referenced to the TMSP peak (δ = 0.0 ppm). 1H NMR spectra were imported into ACD/1D NMR Processor software (Advanced Chemistry Development) where phase and baseline corrections were adjusted and solvent region removal (water: 4.7-5 ppm) was performed."	"Metabolite concentrations were determined using ChenomX NMR Suite Profiler (version 7.7, ChenomX Inc.). TMSP was added to all samples as a reference compound to aid in determining metabolite concentrations."
