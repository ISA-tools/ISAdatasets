Study Title	"Metabolite profiling in LC-DAD using multivariate curve resolution: the alsace package in R"
Study Description	"For those chemical compounds absorbing in the UV–Vis region and not readily applicable to routine mass spectrometry ionisation methods, liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection is a convenient platform to perform metabolite profiling. Data processing by hand is labour-intensive and error prone. In the present study a strategy based on multivariate curve resolution, and its implementation in an R package called alsace are described. The final result of an analysis is a table containing peak heights or peak areas for all features of the individual injections. The capabilities of the software, providing elements such as splitting the data into separate, possibly overlapping time windows, merging the results of the individual time windows, and parametric time warping to align features, are illustrated using a cassava-derived data set."

Study Protocol Description	"A pooled sample was prepared from freeze dried leaves of 22 plants of cassava grown in vitro. The pooled sample was ground to a fine powder using a freezer mill (Specs Centriprep., Stanmore, UK) and stored at -20 °C until the time of extraction. Samples were extracted from homogenised powder (10 mg), adding 800 μl of methanol:water (50:50, v:v) and 800 μl of chloroform, vortexing briefly and subsequently mixing for 1 hr in a Stuart SB3 rotator at 40 rpm (Bibby Scientific Limited, Staffordshire, UK). The samples were then centrifuged for 3 mins at 17000 x g, and the chloroform phase was collected by carefully pipeting. The chloroform phase of 30 samples prepared in this way was collected in a single receptacle. The pooled extract was divided into 200 μl aliquots which were dried by centrifugal evaporation. Samples were stored dry at -20 °C prior to resuspending for chromatography."	"Samples were resuspended in different solvent mixtures (total volume of 50 μl). A series of samples were prepared using 0 to 100% by vol. of ethyl acetate in acetonitrile in steps of 5%. All solvent combinations were tested in triplicate. When the solvent mixture contained ethyl acetate, the latter was the first to be added to assist solubilisation. The dried pellet was resuspended by vortexing and samples were then centrifuged as before. 40 μl of the clear supernatant were transferred to a 2 ml screw cap glass vial with a 250 μl glass insert. Samples were prepared in random order in batches of 24 and placed in the autosampler at 8 °C for chromatography."	"Chromatography was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC equipped with an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 x 100 mm) at 30 °C. Elution was carried out by a gradient of two solvents, A (methanol 50% in water) and B (ethyl acetate 25% in acetonitrile). The gradient started at 30% A, held isocratically for 0.5 min followed by a linear ramp to 0.1% of A for 3.5 min, and holding for 2 min. The column was returned to initial conditions and allowed to equilibrate for 3 min, the total run time being 9 min.
</p>
Elution of isoprenoids was detected with the help of a Waters Acquity UPLC Photodiode Array (PDA) eλ detector. The DAD signal was acquired from 250 to 600 nm (step 1.2 nm) with a resolution of 1.2 nm, at a frequency of 20 points/s."	"Not applicable."	"Not applicable."	"No list of metabolites was generated."
