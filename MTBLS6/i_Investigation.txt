STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS6"
Study Title	"Development and validation of the PyMS Mass Spectrometry software"
Study Description	"To provide useful data for development and validation of the PyMS Mass Spectrometry software, a test dataset was run at Metabolomics Australia. A biologically complex mix of a biological background material (foetal calf serum), spiked with 2-fold increasing amounts of a mix of metabolite standards. In addition, a single sample consisting of a simple mix of 45 metabolites representing a variety of chemical classes (sufars, organic acids, amino acids, sugar phosphates), was run through a standard Metabolomics Australia GC-MS analysis. The resulting data is a valuable tool in testing GC-MS data analysis software."

Study Protocol Description	"Two types of samples were prepared. A mixture of 45 metabolites, representing a variety of chemical classes (sugars, organic acids, amino acids, sugar phosphates), was prepared for GC-MS analysis. 10 µl of the mixture was transferred to a GC-MS vial insert and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The samples were resuspended in 20 mg/ml methoxyamine in pyridine (20 µl, 16 hr, 25 °C) with continuous shaking, followed by derivatization with BSTFA + 1% TMCS (Pierce; 20 µl, 1 hr, 25 °C) using a Gerstel MPS2 autosampler robot. Second group a Foetal calf serum was spiked with 2-fold increasing amounts of a mix of metabolite standards."	"The Foetal calf serum samples (120 µl) were extracted by the addition of 200 µl of 3:2 chloroform:methanol, followed by vigorous mixing and incubation on ice for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 mins at 16,000 rpm to enable biphasic sparation. 15 µl of the upper aqueous phase was transferred to GC-MS vial inserts and dried in vacuo. The samples were resuspended in 20 mg/ml methoxyamine in pyridine (20 µl, 16 hr, 25 °C) with continuous shaking, followed by derivatization with BSTFA + 1% TMCS (Pierce; 20 µl, 1 hr, 25 °C) using a Gerstel MPS2 autosampler robot."	"Gas chromatography was performed using a 30 m VF5-MS column with 0.25 mm inner diameter and 0.25 mm film thickness (Varian Inc.). Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph interfaced with a 5975C mass selective detector."	"The injection temperature was 250 °C, the interface set at 280 °C, and the ionsource adjusted to 250 °C. The carrier gas was helium (flow rate 1 ml/min). The temperature program was 1 min isothermal heating at 70 °C, followed by a 1 °C/min oven temperature ramp to 76 °C, then 5 °C/min to 325 °C and held for 10 min. Mass spectra were recorded at 2.66 scans/s (m/z 50–600)."	"Data Analysis was performed using the PyMS software package (code.google.com/p/pyms). There are two steps, deconvolution (peak picking), and alignment. Each step produces output – for each sample a peak list was created. Deconvolution was carried out using PyMS with the following parameters: Threshold: 6000, Window: 13 scan, Num Ions per Peak: 3, Relative Intensity: 2 and Spectral Skewing parameter: 2 for the Foetal Calf Serum and Threshold: 3000, and Window: 5 scans difference for the Metabolite mix sample. Alignment was carried out using PyMS, with gap penalty 0.3 and retention time modulation parameter 2.5."	"No metabolites were identified."
