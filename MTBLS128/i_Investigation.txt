STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS128"
Study Title	"Comparative LC/MS-based profiling of L-arginine producing, canavanine resistant Corynebacterium glutamicum strain ATCC 21831 and type strain ATCC 13032"
Study Description	"Corynebacterium glutamicum strain ATCC 21831 is a producer of L-arginine that was created by random mutagenesis. It is resistant to the arginine structural analogue canavanine. In order to identify potential bottlenecks in the biosynthetic pathway that leads to this industrially important amino acid, relative metabolite abundances of biosynthetic intermediates were determined in comparison to the type strain ATCC 13032. An extract of U13C-labeled biomass was used as internal standard, to correct for different ionization efficiencies. Metabolites were identified using the ALLocator web platform."

Study Protocol Description	"Corynebacterium glutamicum strains ATCC 13032 and ATCC 21831 were grown on CASO solid agar plates at 30 °C for 36 h. They were inoculated in 10 ml of CGXII medium (pH 7), transferred into 100 ml shake flasks and incubated o/n at 30 °C and 300 rpm. Main cultures, carried out in 250 ml shake flasks with 20 ml CGXII medium, were inoculated from these precultures to an initial optical density of OD600 = 0.4. Cultures were incubated at 30 °C and 300 rpm until mid-exponential growth phase (OD600 = 10). For each strain, four biological replicates were prepared. For the generation of 13C-labeled internal standard, C. glutamicum ATCC 21831 was grown in shake flasks with [U13C]-glucose (1% w/v, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as sole carbon source."	"Frozen cell pellets were freeze-dried within 16 h, using a Christ RVC 2 18 rotational-vacuum-concentrator in combination with a Christ CT 02 50 cooling trap (Martin Christ, Osterode, Germany) and a RZ 2.5 rotary vane pump (Vacuubrand, Wertheim, Germany). 950 mg of silica beads (0.5 mm dia.) and 1 ml of aqueous methanol 80% (v/v) were added and cells were disrupted by shaking 3 times in a Precellys 24 (PEQLAB Biotechnologie, Erlangen, Germany) mill at 6,000 rpm with 1 min cycles and 5 s breaks. Cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at RT for 20 min. Seven hundred microliters of the hydrophilic extracts were transferred into 1.5 ml glass vials and evaporated to complete dryness under a nitrogen stream using a Reacti-Therm III heating/stirring module equipped with a Reacti-Vap III nitrogen evaporator (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Samples were dissolved in 50 µl of water and mixed by vortexing for 10 s. Samples were transferred into 1.5 ml reaction tubes and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min to remove remaining particles. Supernatants were transferred into new 1.5 ml reaction tubes. 13C-labeled extracts were pooled to create a homogenic internal standard. Prior to analysis, a 15 µl aliquot of each sample was transferred into a 1.5 ml glass vial with inlet (5 mm dia.) and 5 µl of 13C-labeled internal standard was added. Samples were mixed by vortexing for 5 s and placed into the autosampler."	"Chromatographic separation of metabolites was performed on a LaChromUltra (Hitachi Europe, UK) HPLC system equipped with a Cogent diamond hydride column (MicroSolv Technologies; 150 x 2.1 mm; 3 m particles) operated in aqueous normal phase mode. Eluent A: 50 % acetonitrile (v/v), 50% water (v/v) + 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and B: 90% acetonitrile (v/v), 10% water (v/v) + 0.1% (v/v) formic acid were prepared freshly and stored in PTFE bottles. Flow rate was set to 400 µl/ min and linear gradient elution was performed as follows: t = 0 min, 100% B; t = 6 min 0% B; t = 7 min, 0% B; t = 8.5 min 100% B; t = 13 min 100% B."	"Eluting compounds were detected from m/z 50-1000 using a micrOTOF-Q II hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with an Apollo II electrospray ion source in positive mode using following instrument settings: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 3.0 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 8 l/min, 180 °C; capillary, -2500 V; end plate offset, -500 V; funnel 1 RF, 180 V; funnel 2 RF, 200 V; in-source CID energy, 0 V; hexapole RF, 100 V; quadrupole ion energy, 5 eV; collision gas, nitrogen; collision energy, 10 eV; collision RF 150 V; transfer time, 70 µs; pre pulse storage, 7 µs; pulser frequency, 10 kHz; spectra rate, 1 Hz. Mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode. Mass calibration of individual raw data files was performed on sodium formate cluster ions obtained by automatic infusion of 20 µl 10 mM sodium hydroxide in isopropanol/water/formic acid, 49.9/49.9/0.2 (v/v/v) immediatly after the injection of the sample. Spectra were obtained with a scan rate of 1 Hz and within an m/z range of 50 - 1000."	"Raw data files were converted to netCDF format using the vendor-specific CompassXport (http://www.bdal.de/) and processed using the ALLocator web platform. Peak detection was done using the XCMS package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html). XCMS settings for processing LC/MS data with findPeaks.centWave() were prefilter=(3,200); snthr=10; ppm=30; peakwidth=(10,60).</br>
</p>
Peak areas of quasimolecular ions were automatically normalized to the area of the corresponding monoisotopic 13C peak and cell dry weight using the ALLocator web platform. Metabolite lists of metabolites with confirmed identity were exported to a spreadsheet. Mean values for each chromatogram group and fold changes between the two groups were calculated."	"Spectral deconvolution and metabolite identification was performed using the ALLocator web platform (https://allocator.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de). Pseudo spectra were initially created using the ALLocatorSD pipeline with the following settings: rtBegin(73); rtEnd(511); epsiolonMZ(0.005); epsilonRT(5.0); minCorrelation(0.75); minIntensity(0); labeled13C(true); omit1000DaMassDecomps(true); inputJobId(86) Metabolites of interest were searched for and the corresponding pseudo spectra were carefully revised. Exact mass measurements and 13C-labeling information were used to calculate sum formulae. Pseudo fragment spectra were compared to MS spectra (level 2) contained in the Massbank database. The identity of L-Glutamate, N-Acetyl-L-glutamate, L-citrulline and L-arginine was also confirmed by the measurement of authentic standards."
