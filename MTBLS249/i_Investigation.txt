Study Title	"Plasma metabolic profile in COPD patients: effects of exercise and endurance training"
Study Description	"The study examines plasma metabolic profiles of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to prove whether the disease influences metabolism at rest and after endurance training. This is based on the hypothesis that metabolome levels should reflect impaired skeletal muscle bioenergetics in COPD. The study aims to test this hypothesis by evaluating plasma metabolic profiles in COPD patients before and after 8 weeks of endurance exercise training. We studied blood samples from 18 COPD patients and 12 healthy subjects. Pre- and post-training blood plasma samples at rest and after constant-work rate exercise (CWRE) at 70% of pretraining Watts peak were analyzed by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess metabolite profiles. The two groups presented training-induced physiological changes in the VO2 peak and in blood lactate levels (P0.01 each). Before training, the two groups also showed differences in metabolic profiles at rest (P0.05). Levels of valine (r = 0.51, P0.01), alanine (r = 0.45, P0.05) and isoleucine (r = 0.51, P0.01) were positively associated with body composition (Fat Free Mass Index). While training showed a significant impact on the metabolic profile in healthy subjects (P0.001), with changes in levels of amino acids, creatine, succinate, pyruvate, glucose and lactate (P0.05 each), no equivalent training-induced effects were seen in COPD patients in whom only lactate decreased (P0.05). This study shows that plasma metabolic profiling contributes to the phenotypic characterization of COPD patients."

Study Protocol Description	"We prospectively recruited 18 clinically stable COPD patients and 12 healthy sedentary (Vilaro et al. 2007) age matched controls. COPD patients did not show episodes of exacerbation nor oral steroid treatment in the previous four months. All patients were on bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. No major co-morbidities were identified in the COPD group. Assessment procedures before inclusion were: 1. Clinical history and physical examination, 2. Pulmonary function testing (Jaeger, MasterScreen; Wuerzburg, Germany), 3. Chest X-ray film and, 4. Twelve lead ECGs. Measurements to characterize the subjects included: (i) Standard incremental cycling exercise protocol (CardiO2 cycle Medical Graphics Corporation, USA), (ii) Body composition analysis assessing fat free mass index (FFMI) by bioimpedance analysis (Quantum X, RJL Systems instruments, Mi, USA) following manufacturer recommendations and (iii) Six minute walking test. Dietary habits were monitored by questionnaire during the study period, but no specific dietary regime was implemented in the two groups. The Human Ethics Committee at Hospital Clinic, Universitat de Barcelona approved the study and informed consent was signed by all subjects. "	"n/a"	"Blood samples were centrifuged at 4–8oC during 10 min and plasma was immediately frozen (-80oC). Prior to the analysis, macromolecules were removed from samples (Kuo et al. 1989; Tiziani et al. 2008). Briefly, Nanosep 3 K cut-off centrifugal devices from Pall Life Sciences were prepared by washing 8 times with 1 ml of 10 mM sodium azide at 1000 g and 30oC for 1 h. Then 500 ll of serum were applied to the filter and the filters were spun for 4 h/ 2oC/10000 g. The filtrate was diluted to 600 ll to give a buffer containing final concentrations of 0.4 mM TMSP, 40 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 8% D2O.
"	"1H-NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on an Avance DRX-500 spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a BACS60 auto-sampler. 24 samples were prepared daily and loaded directly into the auto-sampler. "	"The 1D spectra were acquired using a pulse program based on the Bruker pulse sequence, dpfgse, and water suppression was achieved using excitation sculpting (Hwang and Shaka 1995). The acquisition parameters included a 12 ls 908 pulse, a 6 kHz (12 ppm) spectral width, 128 transients collected into 16 k data points and a 4.4 s recycle time, giving a 10 min total acquisition time. 1H J-resolved 2D spectra (J-RES) (Aue et al. 1976) were acquired with excitation sculpting for water suppression (Hwang and Shaka 1995) and the increase for the indirect time evolution distributed over both spin echoes for suppression of strong coupling artifacts (Thrippleton et al. 2005). Acquisition parameters included a 12 ls 908 pulses, spectral widths of 5.25 kHz (10.5 ppm) in F2 and 50Hz in F1, a recycle time of 4.6 s with 16 transients collected into 16 k data points in F2 and 32 increments in F1. The total acquisition time for each experiment was 38 min. "	"NMRLab (Gunther et al. 2000) was used for the initial processing of J-RES spectra. The window function used in the observe dimension was an unshifted sinebell with 0.8 Hz exponential line broadening. In the indirect dimension, a 20o shifted sinebell was used with 0.5 Hz line broadening. Both dimensions were zero-filled once prior to Fourier transformation. The spectra were phase corrected and were 
referenced using the internal standard, TMSP (0 ppm). Moreover, for pre-processing before modeling, the 2D data was skyline-projected into one dimension and linearly baseline-corrected. Spectra were projected to maintain couplings, i.e. were not tilted. Regions corresponding to the water signal, the TMSP signal, the acetate and EDTA signals were zeroed. The resulting spectra were scaled to a total area of unity, aligned and bucketed with a bucket size of 4 points, and then subjected to a generalized log transformation with k = 5e-8 to increase the weighting of weaker signals in the spectrum giving a final matrix of 124 (samples) 9 4096 (data points in each spectrum). 

A multivariate analysis of the pre-processed NMR data was carried out using PLS-Toolbox (Version 4.1.1; Eigenvector Research, Manson, WA) from of MATLAB (The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). For both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminate Analysis (PLS-DA), the X-block was meancentered prior to analysis. For PLS-DA, the y-block was auto-scaled. 20 statistical outliers from the 124 samples were excluded when building models of the data. Of these, the four samples from persons 14 and 30 contained high levels of ethanol in the blood. The four samples from person 29 gave spectra with 3 extra peaks not seen for other samples. For the cross-validation of PLS-DA we used Venetian blinds with 20 as the maximum number of latent variables and with 10 data splits. For the PLS-DA model (healthy pre-exercise, COPD pre-exercise) only, the X-block was mean-centered and then subject to orthogonal signal correction (OSC) prior to analysis. With PLSDA, the loadings of the first latent variable (LV) respectively were examined in the Chenomx NMR software suite (Professional Edition, Version 4.6, Chenomx, Inc.) to identify contributing metabolites. We identified 12 metabolites: amino acids (glutamine, tyrosine, alanine, valine, isoleucine) citrate, glucose, pyruvate, succinate, lactate, creatine and creatinine."	"n/a"
