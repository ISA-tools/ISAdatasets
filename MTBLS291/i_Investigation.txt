STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS291"
Study Title	"LipidFrag: Improving reliability of in silico fragmentation of lipids and application to the Caenorhabditis elegans lipidome"
Study Description	"Lipid identification is a major bottleneck in high-throughput lipidomics studies. We combined the in silico fragmentation tool MetFrag with LipidMaps lipid-class specific classifiers which calculate probabilities for lipid class assignments. The LipidFrag approach was then applied to MS/MS spectra of lipid extracts of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans."

Study Protocol Description	"Lipids were extracted from young adult Caenorhabditis elegans using a modified method from [1], described in [2]. The worms were washed off the plates and their metabolism was quenched with 500 µl -20 °C MeOH. Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C prior to extraction.

C. elegans were lysed for 30 min in an ice cold ultrasonic bath, after which 420 µl of water was added and samples were sonicated for further 15 min. Phases were separated by centrifugation at 4 °C and 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The upper organic phase was transferred to a 4 ml glass vial and the remaining lower phase was re-extracted with additional 650 µl MTBE for 15 min. After centrifugation the organic layers were combined and evaporated in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator. The residue was redissolved in 500 µl ACN/iPrOH/water (65/30/5, v/v/v)."	"Separation was achieved on a Waters Cortecs C18 column, 150 mm x 2.1 mm ID, 1.6 µm using a Waters Acquity UPLC (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) coupled to a Bruker maXis UHR-ToF-MS (Bruker Daltonic, Bremen, Germany). Flow rate was 0.25 ml/min and column temperature was set to 50 °C. Eluent A consisted of 60% ACN and 40% water, eluent B of 90% iPrOH and 10% ACN, both with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid."	"Detection was carried out on a Bruker maXis UHR-ToF-MS (Bruker Daltonic, Bremen, Germany) in positive and negative ionization mode with data dependent acquisition with a scan rate of 5 Hz and selection of 2 precursors. Masses were excluded from DDA after 3 spectra and released from exclusion after 0.15 min. An absolute threshold of 1500 was used for selection."	"MS data was imported to Genedata Expressionist for Mass Spectrometry 8.2 (Genedata, Basel, Switzerland) for internal re-calibration, retention time alignment and peak picking. Files were exported to .xlsx format and further data handling was carried out in MS Excel. MS/MS spectra were exported from the calibrated and aligned chromatograms from Genedata Expressionist for MS 8.2 as .mgf file. Only spectra associated with a detected feature were kept."	"Lipids were annotated with a new in-house version of MassTRIX to also cover the adducts [M+NH4]+ and [M+FA-H]-.
</p>
Spectra associated with a detected feature were converted to MetFrag batch files (available at http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/msbi/lipidfrag) using a custom Perl script. The neutral mass and formula for the batch file were obtained by annotation with MassTRIX. Finally, spectra in batch files were de-isotoped using the CAMERA package with a custom R script."
