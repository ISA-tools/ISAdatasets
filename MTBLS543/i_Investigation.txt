Study Title	"Synovial Fluid Metabolites Differentiate between Septic and Nonseptic Joint Pathologies"
Study Description	"Osteoarthritis (OA), osteochondrosis (OC), and synovial sepsis in horses cause loss of function and pain. Reliable biomarkers are required to achieve accurate and rapid diagnosis, with synovial fluid (SF) holding a unique source of biochemical information. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy allows global metabolite analysis of a small volume of SF, with minimal sample preprocessing using a noninvasive and nondestructive method. Equine SF metabolic profiles from both nonseptic joints (OA and OC) and septic joints were analyzed using 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to identify differential metabolite abundance between groups. Metabolites were annotated via 1H NMR using 1D NMR identification software Chenomx, with identities confirmed using 1D 1H and 2D 1H 13C NMR. Multivariate analysis identified separation between septic and nonseptic groups. Acetate, alanine, citrate, creatine phosphate, creatinine, glucose, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, phenylalanine, pyruvate, and valine were higher in the nonseptic group, while glycylproline was higher in sepsis. Multivariate separation was primarily driven by glucose; however, partial-least-squares discriminant analysis plots with glucose excluded demonstrated the remaining metabolites were still able to discriminate the groups. This study demonstrates that a panel of synovial metabolites can distinguish between septic and nonseptic equine SF, with glucose the principal discriminator."

Study Protocol Description	"Following ethical approval and owner consent, synovial fluid (SF) was aspirated from pathological joints (including the metacarpophalangeal, metatarsophalangeal, tarsocrural, stifle and shoulder joints) from 4 horses diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA), 6 with osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), 2 with meniscal tears (MT), 6 with synovial sepsis secondary to a penetrating wound and 1 with a systemic blood sepsis. The SF was immediately placed into uncoated 1.5 ml collection tubes and processed within 1 hr of collection. Particulate and cells were removed from the SF by centrifugation (4 ºC, 2540 x g for 5 min) before the cell-free supernatant transferred to a clean uncoated 1.5 ml collection tube, snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ºC."	"No extraction was performed in this study."	"Synovial fluid (SF) was thawed over ice and diluted to produce a final 1 ml volume containing 50% (v/v) SF, 40% (v/v) dd H2O, 10% (v/v) 1 M PO4(3-) pH 7.4 buffer (Na2HPO4, VWR International Ltd., Radnor, Pennsylvania, USA and NaH2PO4, Sigma-Aldrich) in deuterated water and 0.0025% (v/v) sodium azide (NaN3, Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were then vortexed for 1 min, centrifuged at 13,000 x g and 4 ºC for 2 min and 600 µl transferred to 5 mm outer diameter NMR tubes using a clean glass pasteur pipette."	"1D 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance III 600MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TCI cryoprobe at pH 7.4 and 25 ºC."	"1D 1H standard CPMG-type metabolomics experiment with optimal water suppression was acquired with the cpmgpr1d filters for small molecules via a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence. Spectra were acquired with 32 transients, a 15 ppm spectral width, 32k points, 9.6 ms echo time, a 3.1 s acquisition time, and a 4 s interscan delay."	"Automated data processing, Fourier transformation, and phasing were carried out in Topspin v3.2 software using standard Bruker routines. The spectra were then normalised to the median and bucketed per peak into a matrix of metabolite peak intensities using AMIX v3.9.14."	"Chenomx v8.2 software used for initial metabolite identification with manual confirmation to in-house standards for metabolite peaks found to be significantly variable.
</p>
Statistical test:</br>
The prepared bucket table was subjected to univariate and multivariate analysis. Student T-test were applied on the spectra after determining the data were parametric using ggplot function in R. Unsupervised multivariate analysis of the spectra was carried after out using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The data was scaled by mean centering of each variable followed by division of the square root of the standard deviation (Pareto scaling) before analysis. The PCA reduced the 300 spectral buckets of each sample to X principal components (PCs) in cells, Y PCs in tumours and Z PCs in the combined analysis (explaining 95% or the variance in each analysis). The loadings of each PCA were analysed to identify the most influential buckets (and thus metabolites) responsible for the clustering observed."
