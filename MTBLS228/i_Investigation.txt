Study Title	"Untargeted extraction of metabolites 13C labeling profiles from time course labeling switch experiment"
Study Description	"Dynamic isotope labeling data provide crucial information about the operation of metabolic pathways, and are commonly generated via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Metabolome-wide analysis is challenging as it requires grouping of metabolite features over different samples. We developed DynaMet for fully automated investigations of isotope labeling experiments from LC-high resolution MS raw data. DynaMet enables untargeted extraction of metabolite labeling profiles and provides integrated tools for expressive data visualization. For this study we generated labeling data of the model strain Bacillus methanolicus from 13C methanol resulting in complex spectra in multi carbon compounds. Analysis of two biological replicates revealed high robustness and reproducibility of the pipeline. In total, DynaMet extracted 386 features showing dynamic labeling within ten minutes. Of these features, 357 could be fitted by implemented kinetic models. Feature identification against KEGG database resulted in 247 matches covering multiple pathways of core metabolism and major biosynthetic routes. The study results reported here are only a summary. To reproduce the complete results including plots, DynaMet software is required."

Study Protocol Description	"B. Methanolicus MGA3 cells were sampled at OD600 between 1 and 1.5. To perform 13C labeling , 0.5 ml of B. methanolicus MGA3 culture grown in bioreactors with naturally labeled methanol was transferred into 50 ml Falcon tubes containing 4.5 ml of temperature adjusted (50 °C) MSV medium with 0.5 M 99% 13C methanol. Samples in tubes were continuously mixed and incubated for 5 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 60 s, 120 s, 300 s, and 600 s at the respective temperatures before the entire 5 ml was transferred onto a 0.2 µm polyethylensulfon (PESU) filter (Sartorius Stedium). Cells were vacuum filtered and immediately washed with 10 ml warm MilliQ water (20 °C) to remove culture medium."	"For quenching and metabolite extraction, filters with cells were transferred into 8 ml quenching solution (mixture of acetonitrile, methanol and 0.5 M formic acid at a 60:20:20 ratio) at -20 °C, incubated for 10 minutes on ice and sonified 3 times for 10 s based on a protocol adapted from [1]. Samples were snap frozen in liquid N2, lyophilized and stored at -20 °C until analysis. Prior to analysis, samples were resuspended with MilliQ water to a final biomass concentration of 1 µg/µl. Biomass content of the samples was calculated based on sample volume and corresponding culture OD600.

The TBA solution (solvent A) was obtained by dissolving 1.7 mM TBA in 1.5 mM acetic acid; the pH was adjusted to 9.0 with 6 M ammonium hydroxide. Solvent B (methanol) varied according to the gradient under a flow rate of 400 nl/min as follows: 0 min, 3%; 30 min, 90%; 35 min, 90%; 36 min, 3%; and 45 min, 3%. The injection volume was 1 µl.

All further Processing was performed with DynaMet app, an extension package from emzed (installation can be found at http://emzed.ethz.ch/installation.html). After installation of emzed, DynaMet can be directly installed by typing following command in the IPython console: !pip install dynamet. An overview of all processing steps is shown in the file 'Data Transformation Protocol.txt' which is available in the study folder."	"Metabolite identification was performed using identification module of Dynamet software. To match features to data base, monoisotopic masses of features are calculated from possible adducts mass shifts. In case of successful adduct grouping the assigned monoisotopic mass is used to search for masses in database within user defined maximal deviation whereby matches are further restricted by estimation of metabolites possible number of carbon atoms. We estimated the number of carbon atoms from mass isotopologue pattern of natural labeled, and if provided, from a mixture of natural labeled and uniformly 13C labeled cell extract. As a general restriction the range of the possible number of carbon atoms is calculated for each metabolite, whereby the lower limit is defined by the number of 13C related mass isotopologues grouped per feature and the upper limit by the compound with similar mass present in the Pubchem database containing most number of carbon atoms. Depending on the consistency and reliability of the results obtained by applied estimation methods, each estimation gets a quality score (q-score) ranging from 0 to 15, and best scored estimation is selected. For the current study the KEGG database was used.
</p>
For each compound in each sample we determined the summed number of labeled Carbon atoms:</br>
n_13C=(f_M0 * f_M1*1 + f_Mn *n)</br>
where n is number of C atoms, f_Mi is f_Mi=A_Mi/A_tot and A_Mi is ith isotopologue of metabolite i, A_tot is summed area of all isotopologues, A_tot=summed area of all isotopologue of a feauture where m is the metabolites number of carbon atoms.</br>"
