STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS317"
Study Title	"FDR-controlled metabolite annotation for high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry - simulated Imaging MS (Imaging simulation assay)"
Study Description	"High-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry promises to localize hundreds of metabolites directly from tissues, cell cultures, and agar plates with cellular resolution, but is hampered by the lack of bioinformatics for automated metabolite identification. We developed the first bioinformatics framework for False Discovery Rate (FDR)-controlled metabolite annotation for high-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry (https://github.com/alexandrovteam/pySM) introducing a Metabolite-Signal Match (MSM) score and a target-decoy FDR-estimate for spatial metabolomics. MALDI-FTICR datasets acquired from normal rat brain were used for the development of spatial metabolomics annotation bioinformatics. This study together with MTBLS313 and MTBLS378 provide the accompanying data for FDR-controlled metabolite annotation for high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry."

Study Protocol Description	"Not applicable"	"Not applicable"	"Not applicable"	"Not applicable"	"Not applicable"	"An imaging MS dataset was simulated that contained 300 sum formulas from the HMDB metabolite database, version 2.5, and 300 randomly generated formulas not contained in HMDB. To each sum formula, either +H, +Na, or +K adduct was randomly assigned. Random sum formulas were generated such that the probability distributions of the number of CHNOPS atoms, the C-H ratio, and the C-O ratio are the same as all formulas from HMDB. Isotope patterns were generated for each formula at a resolving power of R=140000 at m/z 400. Each isotope pattern was multiplied by a random intensity in the range [0.2-1.0]. The patterns were assigned to one of two partially overlapping square regions: one with sum formulas from HMDB, the other with sum formulas not from HMDB. Additionally 700 peaks at randomly selected m/z-values were added independently to each spectrum so that a spectrum inside one of the squares would have 3500 Â± 127 peaks. The resulted line spectra were then convolved with a Gaussian function with the sigma equal to 0.015."
