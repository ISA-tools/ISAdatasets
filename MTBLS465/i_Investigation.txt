Study Title	"A Metabonomic Comparison of Human Serum and Plasma Subtypes Using Untargeted NMR Spectroscopy and UPLC-MS (UPLC-MS assays)"
Study Description	"INTRODUCTION: Differences in the metabolite profiles between serum and plasma are incompletely understood. </br> OBJECTIVES: To evaluate metabolic profile differences between serum and plasma and among plasma sample subtypes. </br> METHODS: We analyzed serum, platelet rich plasma (PRP), platelet poor plasma (PPP), and platelet free plasma (PFP), collected from 8 non-fasting apparently healthy women, using untargeted standard 1D and CPMG 1H NMR and reverse phase and hydrophilic (HILIC) UPLC-MS. Differences between metabolic profiles were evaluated using validated principal component and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. </br> RESULTS: Explorative analysis showed the main source of variation among samples was due to inter-individual differences with no grouping by sample type. After correcting for inter-individual differences, lipoproteins, lipids in VLDL/LDL, lactate, glutamine, and glucose were found to discriminate serum from plasma in NMR analyses. In UPLC-MS analyses, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysoPE)(18:0) and lysophosphatidic acid(20:0) were higher in serum, and phosphatidylcholines (PC)(16:1/18:2, 20:3/18:0, O-20:0/22:4), lysoPC(16:0), PE(O-18:2/20:4), sphingomyelin(18:0/22:0), and linoleic acid were lower. In plasma subtype analyses, isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, glutamate, and pyruvate were higher among PRP samples compared with PPP and PFP by NMR while lipids in VLDL/LDL, citrate, and glutamine were lower. By UPLC-MS, PE(18:0/18:2) and PC(P-16:0/20:4) were higher in PRP compared with PFP samples. </br> CONCLUSIONS: Correction for inter-individual variation was required to detect metabolite differences between serum and plasma. Our results suggest the potential importance of inter-individual effects and sample type on the results from serum and plasma metabolic phenotyping studies. </br></br> UPLC-MS protocols and data are reported in the current study MTBLS465. </br> NMR protocols and data associated to this study are reported in MTBLS470. </br><br/> Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS470' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS470</span></a>"

Study Protocol Description	"For preparation of serum and plasma, blood was collected from 8 apparently healthy non-fasting middle-aged female volunteers into 10 ml Serum Separator Tubes (SST; containing clot activator and serum separator gel) and 10-ml lithium heparin venipuncture tubes, respectively (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Blood collected into serum tubes was inverted 5 times and allowed to clot at room temperature (RT) for 45 min prior to centrifugation (2000 x g for 10 min at RT).
</p>
Platelet rich plasma (PRP), platelet poor plasma (PPP), and platelet free plasma (PFP) were prepared from blood collected into lithium heparin tubes. PRP was prepared by centrifugation at 200 x g  for 10 min (no brake); PPP was centrifuged at 2000 x g for 10 min (low brake); and, PFP was prepared by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 10 min (low brake), aliquoting the plasma into 1-ml conical vials, followed by a second centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 7 min (all at RT). Following centrifugation, samples were aliquoted into 1-ml conical vials and frozen at -80 °C."	"To prepare the samples for metabolic profiling samples were removed from the freezer, thawed at room temperature. The samples were treated with ice cold IPA 1:3 (v:v, sample:IPA), incubated for 2 hr in the freezer, centriduged for 10 min at maximum speed. The supernatent was analysed on the instrument."	"RP and HILIC seperation were performed using a Waters Acquity Ultra Performance LC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Separation of lipid components by reverse phase was performed according to the Waters application publication[1]. HILIC separation was performed as previously described[2].

PMID:20448546</br>"	"RP and HILIC UPLC-MS metabolic profiling experiments were coupled to Xevo G2 Q-TOF (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with an electrospray source. The serum samples were first subjected to analysis using UPLC-MS, with both positive and negative MS ionisation detection. Capillary and cone voltages were set at 1.5 kV and 30 V, respectively. The desolvation gas was set to 1000 l/hr at a temperature of 600 °C; the cone gas was set to 50 l/hr and the source temperature was set to 120 °C. For mass accuracy a lock-spray interface was used with leucine-enkephalin (556.27741/554.2615 amu) solution at a concentration of 2000 ng/ml and at a flow rate of 15 µl/min as the lock mass."	"All the raw spectrometric data for the four different data sets (RP UPLC-MS (ESI+), RP UPLC-MS (ESI-), HILIC UPLC-MS (ESI+) and HILIC UPLC-MS(ESI-) were processed using xcms in R. The centwave peak picking methods were used to detect chromatographic peaks and the data were normalized using probabilistic quotient normalization using the median spectrum as the reference."	"Multivariate principal component analysis was used to examine the data sets and to observe clustering in the results according to predefined classes. Univariate logistic regression was performed for each MS feature in the data sets."
