Study Identifier	"MTBLS426"
Study Title	"Sexual dimorphism in the fetal cardiac response to maternal nutrient restriction."
Study Description	"Poor maternal nutrition causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); however, its effects on fetal cardiac development are unclear. We have developed a baboon model of moderate maternal undernutrition, leading to IUGR. We hypothesized that the IUGR affects fetal cardiac structure and metabolism. Six control pregnant baboons ate ad-libitum (CTRL)) or 70% CTRL from 0.16 of gestation (G). Fetuses were euthanized at C-section at 0.9G under general anesthesia. Male but not female IUGR fetuses showed left ventricular fibrosis inversely correlated with birth weight. Expression of extracellular matrix protein TSP-1 was increased (p<0.05) in male IUGR. Expression of cardiac fibrotic markers TGFß, SMAD3 and ALK-1 were downregulated in male IUGRs with no difference in females. Autophagy was present in male IUGR evidenced by upregulation of ATG7 expression and lipidation LC3B. Global miRNA expression profiling revealed 56 annotated and novel cardiac miRNAs exclusively dysregulated in female IUGR, and 38 cardiac miRNAs were exclusively dysregulated in males (p<0.05). Fifteen (CTRL) and 23 (IUGR) miRNAs, were differentially expressed between males and females (p<0.05) suggesting sexual dimorphism, which can be at least partially explained by differential expression of upstream transcription factors (e.g. HNF4a, and NF?B p50). Lipidomics analysis of fetal cardiac tissue exhibited a net increase in diacylglycerol and plasmalogens and a decrease in triglycerides and phosphatidylcholines. In summary, IUGR resulting from decreased maternal nutrition is associated with sex-dependent dysregulations in cardiac structure, miRNA expression, and lipid metabolism. If these changes persist postnatally, they may program offspring for higher later life cardiac risk."

Study Protocol Description	"38 female baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis) from the Southwest National Primate Research Center at San Antonio, Texas, USA were recruited for this study and maintained in group housing.
</p>
Surgical procedures were performed by a fully certified MD or DVM, and postsurgical care was prescribed and monitored by a primate center veterinarian. Cesarean sections were performed at 165d G (0.9G) using standard techniques that have been previously described in detail[1]. All baboons were premedicated with ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg, i.m.).  After intubation, isoflurane (2%) was used to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia throughout surgery. Following hysterotomy, the umbilical cord was identified and used for fetal exsanguination while under general anesthesia as approved by the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia. The placenta and fetus were removed from the uterus and immediately submitted for morphometric analyses and tissue sampling. Fetal morphometrics was obtained at necropsy. Post-operative maternal analgesia was by buprenorphine hydrochloride (Buprenorphine HCl Injection, Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL) 0.015 mg/kg/d split as 2 doses for 3 days. After recovery in individual cages, mothers were returned to their group housing.

PMID:17391566</br>"	"Tissues were homogenized in cold methanol using a tissue homogenizer (Bullet Blender), and then water and chloroform were added to get a final proportion of chloroform/methanol/water of 2/1/0.6 (v/v/v). The sample was then vigorously vortexed, incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm and 4 °C. The bottom organic phase was collected into autosampler vials, dried in a vacuum centrifuge and dissolved in methanol for the liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis."	"Total lipid extracts were injected onto a Waters column (HSS T3 1.0 mm x 150 mm x 1.8 µm particle size). Lipids were separated using a 92 min gradient at a flow rate of 30 µl/min. Mobile phase A was a 40:60 mixture of ACN/H2O containing 10 mM ammonium acetate and mobile phase B was a 10:90 mixture of ACN/IPA containing 10 mM ammonium acetate."	"Samples were analyzed with an Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap Velos, Thermo Fisher Scientific) employing both HCD (high-energy collision dissociation) and CID (collision-induced dissociation) fragmentation."	"Raw data files were converted to mzXML format after identification prior to being uploaded into MZmine2 using the ProteoWizard MSConvert tool."	"The LC-MS/MS data were analyzed with LIQUID[1] and each of the identified lipid species were manually validated. Identified lipids were quantified using MZmine2 to extract peak intensities.
