STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS523"
Study Title	"Epithelial-Cell-Derived Phospholipase A2 Group 1B Is an Endogenous Anthelmintic."
Study Description	"Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A2 group 1B (PLA2g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA2g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b-/- mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b-/- mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA2g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity."

Study Protocol Description	"Infective L3 Heligmosomoides polygyrus larvae were exsheathed as previously described[1]. Briefly, 0.85% w/v NaCl (in distilled water) was bubbled with 40% CO2 in Nitrogen for 5 min, the tube was then sealed and incubated in a 37 °C waterbath for a further 5 min. The pH was adjusted to pH 2 using HCl and 5 ml was added to 30000-50000 L3 larvae before bubbling with 40% CO2 in Nitrogen for 30 s. The tube was then sealed and incubated in a 37 °C waterbath for a further 30 min. Exsheathed L3 larvae were washed and counted before treatment with PLA2g1B. 8000 exsheathed L3 H. polygyrus larvae were treated with recombinant mouse PLA2g1B (Elabscience), recombinant mouse PLA2g1B plus manoalide (200 ng/μl final concentration, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or heat inactivated recombinant mouse PLA2g1B in 1ml EnzChek® PLA2 reaction buffer (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 24 hr. Recombinant mouse PLA2g1B was heat inactivated by heating at 100 °C for 4 hr. Following treatment, larvae were washed with MilliQ water prior to infection.

PMID:4570979</br>"	"Lipids were extracted from H. polygyrus L3 larvae using a method adapted from a previous publication[1]. Briefly, following PLA2g1B treatment ~8000 H. polygyrus larvae were washed 3 times with MilliQ water, resuspended in 2 ml methanol and heated in a sealed tube under nitrogen at 55 °C for 20 min. After cooling, 4 ml chloroform was added and the sample was agitated with a magnetic stirrer for 3 hr. The organic phase was removed and the residue ground (using a glass homogenizer) and extracted with 2 ml chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) for 2 hr.

PMID:5924644</br>"	"Lipids were dried under nitrogen and redissolved in 100 μl of methanol/chloroform (1:1 v/v) and diluted 1:2 with solvent A (hexane:isopropanol, 70:30 [v: v], 0.02% [m/v] formic acid, 0.01% [m/v] ammonium hydroxide), centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min to remove trace non-lipidic materials prior to transfer to a glass autosampler vial (Agilent). 10 μl was injected onto a BETASIL diol column (5 um x 150 mm x 2.1 mm, with BETASIL diol guard column (10 mm x 2.1 mm), held at 20 °C) in an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system coupled to a Thermo Exactive Plus Orbitrap MS for full scan or Q Exactive Orbitrap MS for MS/MS scan. Lipids were eluted at 0.15 ml/min with a binary gradient from 0% to 100% solvent B (isopropanol:methanol, 70:30 [v/v], 0.02% [m/v] formic acid, 0.01% [m/v] ammonium hydroxide): 0–10 min, 0% B; 17–22 min, 50% B; 30–35 min, 100% B; 40–44 min, 0% B, followed by additional 6 min 0% B post-run."	"MS data were acquired on a Thermo Exactive-plus Orbitrap MS in both polarities using a full scan method. The positive and negative HESI-II spray voltages were 4.5 and 3.5 kV, respectively; the heated capillary temperature was 250 °C; the sheath gas pressure was 30 psi; the auxiliary gas setting was 20 psi; and the heated vaporizer temperature was 150 °C. Both the sheath gas and the auxiliary gas were nitrogen. The parameters of the full mass scan were as follows: a resolution of 70,000, an auto gain control target under 3 x 10^6, a maximum isolation time of 200 ms, and an m/z range 200–3000. To confirm the identification of significant features, samples were re-ran in PRM (parallel reaction monitoring) mode on a Thermo Q-Excative Orbitrap MS. Parameters as follows: a resolution of 17,500, an auto gain control target under 2 x 10^5, a maximum isolation time of 100 ms, an isolation window of m/z 0.4 and normalized collision energy were optimized for each feature individually."	"Data were acquired using Xcalibur 3.0.63 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Progenesis (Nonlinear Dynamics) was used for data alignment and peak detection. Data were normalized against the total ion abundance."	"Annotations were assigned to accurate masses with a maximum error of 5 ppm using Metlin, LipidMaps, Kegg and HMDB which were searched simultaneously using the CEU Mass Mediator engine (http://ceumass.eps.uspceu.es/mediator/). For significantly changing annotated features, MS/MS was performed to further confirm identity. Identifications were found for 6 features."
