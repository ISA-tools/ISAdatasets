Investigation Title	"A multi-omic profiles of fruits regarding the maturation of Olive (Olea europaea L.)"
Investigation Description	"Olive (Olea europaea) has a long history of medicinal and nutritional values own to it rich in polyphenol and fatty acids (FAs) in fruits. In order to better understand the biosynthesis important of these metabolites, we generated comprehensive Iso-Seq full-length and illumina RNA-seq transcriptome, and targeted metabolomics dataset of different olive fruits maturity. The targeted metabolomics by using both GC/MS and LC/MS were totally quantified 35 FAs and 13 polyphenols. Iso-Seq library was constructed and sequenced by PacBio Sequel System, and a total of 5,891,652 (10.55 G) with an average length of 1,791 subreads were obtained. 492,350 circular consensus sequences (CCSs) were formed after merging and error correction through subread comparison. Of the 492,350 CCSs, 399,263 were found to be full-length non chimera (FLNC) reads, and 187,517 consensus reads were finally obtained by using clustering algorithm of Iterative clustering for error (IEC). These multiomics data provide a foundation to elucidate the mechanisms regulating biosynthesis of polyphenol and FAs during the maturation of olive fruits."

Study Protocol Description	"The 15-year-old Olive (<i>Olea europaea L.</i>) trees were grown in the garden of Research Institute of Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry in Longnan Gansu province of China. The fruit samples were collected at 5 developmental stages: 50, 80, 110, 140 and 170 days after flowering (DAF)."	"40 mg of sample was dried at 60 °C until there is mo more loss in weight. 3 ml methanol was added to the sample which was then sonicated at room temperature for 30 min. This step was repeated. The solution was centrifuged, the supernatant was removed and dried under vacuum. The dried supernatant was reconstituted in 400 µl 100% methanol. Finally, the solution was diluted by 200 times and passed through a 0.22 µm filter for LC analysis."
