Study Title	"Quantitative trait loci analysis identifies a prominent gene involved in the production of fatty-acid-derived flavor volatiles in tomato"
Study Description	"To gain insight into the genetic regulation of lipid metabolism in tomato, we conducted metabolic trait loci (mQTL) analysis following the lipidomic profiling of fruit pericarp and leaf tissue of the Solanum pennellii introgression lines. To enhance mapping resolution for selected fruit-specific mQTL, we profiled the lipids in a subset of independently derived S. pennellii backcross inbred lines, as well as in a near-isogenic (sub-IL) population. We identified a putative lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase that controls the levels of several lipids, and two members of the class III lipase family, LIP1 and LIP2, that were associated with decreased levels of diacylglycerols (DAGs) and triacylglycerols (TAGs). Lipases of this class cleave fatty acids from the glycerol backbone of acylglycerols. The released fatty acids serve as precursors of flavor volatiles. We show that LIP1 expression correlates with fatty-acid-derived volatile levels. We further confirm the function of LIP1 in TAG and DAG breakdown and volatile synthesis using transgenic plants. In summary, this study provides an extensive characterization of the genetic architecture of lipophilic compounds in tomato in addition to zooming down to the molecular level to demonstrate that release of free fatty acids from the glycerol backbone can have a major impact on downstream volatile synthesis."

Study Protocol Description	"The fruit lipid data set presented is based on field-grown introgression lines over 2 harvests, 2001 and 2003[1]. Plants were grown in the Western Galilee Experimental Station in Akko, Israel, in a completely randomized design with 1 plant/m^2. Seedlings were grown in greenhouses for 35 to 40 days and then transferred to the field. The field was irrigated with 320 m^3 of water/1000 m^3 of field area throughout the season. The harvest of fruit was done when 80 to 100% of tomatoes were red[2].
</p>
The leaf lipid data set was obtained from plants grown in the greenhouse in Golm, Germany. In the early March seeds of all 76 Solanum pennellii-derived ILs population[2]. Seeds were grown for 50 days in a randomized design in a control greenhouse. Plant were top watered.  Each IL was planted in at least 4 replicates with at least 1 replicate of parental line M82. Mature leaves were harvested in 50th day of growth and placed into 5 ml tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Briefly, 120 mg of frozen peeled fruit pericarp (50 mg of leaves) was homogenized using Frosty for 2 x 90 s at maximum speed. Metabolites from each aliquot were extracted with 1 ml of pre-cooled (-20 °C) extraction buffer (homogenous methanol:methyl-tert-butyl-eter (1:3) mixture). After 10 min incubation in 4 °C and sonication for 10 min in sonic bath, 500 µl of water/methanol mixture was added. Samples were then centrifuged (5 min, 14000 x g), which led to the formation of 2 phases: a lipophilic phase and a polar phase. 500 µl of the lipophilic phase was collected, dried under vacuum and re-suspended in 200 µl of ASN:Isopropanol and was used for lipid anaylsis.

The mobile phases consisted of 1% 1 M NH4OAc and 0.1% acetic acid in water (Buffer A) and acetonitrile/isopropanol (7:3, UPLC grade BioSolve) supplemented with 1 M NH4ac, 0.1 % acetic acid (Buffer B). The dried lipid extracts were re-suspended in 500 µl buffer B. The following gradient profile was applied: 1 min 45% A, 3 min linear gradient from 45% A to 35% A, 8 min linear gradient from 25 to 11% A, 3 min linear gradient from 11 to 1% A. Finally, after washing the column for 3 min with 1% A the buffer is set back to 45% A, and the column is re-equilibrating for 4 min, leading to a total run time of 22 min. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 400 µl/min.

All the spectra were recorded using altering full scan and all-ion fragmentation scan mode, covering a mass range from 100–1500m/z at a capillary voltage of 3.0 kV with a sheath gas flow value of 60 and an auxiliary gas flow of 35. The resolution was set to 10,000 with 10 scans/s, restricting the Orbitrap loading time to a maximum of 100 ms with a target value of 1E^6 ions. The capillary temperature was set to 150 °C, while the drying gas in the heated electro spray source was set to 350 °C. The skimmer voltage was held at 25 V while the tube lens was set to a value of 130 V. The spectra were recorded from 1 min to 20 min of the UPLC gradients."	"Processing of chromatograms, peak detection and integration were performed using REFINER MS® 10.0 (GeneData, http://www.genedata.com) or Xcalibur (Version 3.1, Thermo-Fisher, Bremen, Germany). In the first approach the molecular masses, retention time, and associated peak intensities for the three replicates of each sample were extracted from the raw files, which contained the full scan MS and the all-ion fragmentation MS data."	"Processing of mass spectrometry data included the removal of the fragmentation information, isotopic peaks, as well as chemical noise. Further peak filtering on the manually extracted spectra or the aligned data matrices was performed. Obtained features (m/z at a certain retention time) were queried against an in-house lipid database for further annotation. Database used in this project includes nearly 200 lipid species of the following classes: diacylglycerols (DAGs), digalactosyldiacylglycerols (DGDGs), monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDGs), phosphatitylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), phosphatidylglycerols (PGs), phosphatidylserine (PSs), phosphatitylinositols (PIs), sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols (SQDGs), and triacylglycerides (TAGs)."
