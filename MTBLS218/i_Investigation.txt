Study Identifier	"MTBLS218"
Study Title	"An untargeted metabolomics approach to characterize short-term and long-term metabolic changes after bariatric surgery"
Study Description	"Bariatric surgery is currently one of the most effective treatments for obesity and leads to significant weight reduction, improved cardiovascular risk factors and overall survival in treated patients. To date, most studies focused on short-term effects of bariatric surgery on the metabolic profile and found high variation in the individual responses to surgery. The aim of this study was to identify relevant metabolic changes not only shortly after bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) but also up to one year after the intervention by using untargeted metabolomics. 132 serum samples taken from 44 patients before surgery, after hospital discharge (1–3 weeks after surgery) and at a 1-year follow-up during a prospective study (NCT01271062) performed at two study centers (Austria and Switzerland). The samples included 24 patients with type 2 diabetes at baseline, thereof 9 with diabetes remission after one year. The samples were analyzed by using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS, HILIC-QExactive). Raw data was processed with XCMS and drift-corrected through quantile regression based on quality controls. 177 relevant metabolic features were selected through Random Forests and univariate testing and 36 metabolites were identified. Identified metabolites included trimethylamine-N-oxide, alanine, phenylalanine and indoxyl-sulfate which are known markers for cardiovascular risk. In addition we found a significant decrease in alanine after one year in the group of patients with diabetes remission relative to non-remission. Our analysis highlights the importance of assessing multiple points in time in subjects undergoing bariatric surgery to enable the identification of biomarkers for treatment response, cardiovascular benefit and diabetes remission. Key-findings include different trend pattern over time for various metabolites and demonstrated that short term changes should not necessarily be used to identify important long term effects of bariatric surgery."

Study Protocol Description	"Serum samples from 44 obese patients included in the study were analysed: 29 females (BMI: 44.2 ± 4.9, Age: 44±11) and 15 males (BMI: 45.2 ± 7.1, Age: 48 ± 15). The venous blood samples were collected, the blood was allowed to clot (30 min, 25 °C), the serum was separated by centrifugation (2000g, 4 °C, 30 min) and afterwards immediately stored at -80 °C."	"Serum samples were processed as published [1]. Briefly, 200 µl of serum were transferred to 1.5 ml tubes and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 g. 800 µl methanol (cooled to -80 °C) were added and mixed with the samples. Samples were incubated overnight at -80 °C then centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was transferred to 1.5 ml tubes. Samples were evaporated to dryness by using nitrogen and reconstituted in 200 µl 30% methanol.

Separation was performed using eluent A: 20 mM ammonium acetate + 20 mM ammonium hydroxide in 95:5 water: acetonitrile, pH 9.45; Eluent B: acetonitrile. The gradient was as follows: t=0 min, 85% B; t = 15 min 0% B; t=20 min 0% B; t=22min 85% B; t=37min 85% B. Flow rate was set to 150 µl/min.  Full scan spectra were recorded in positive and in negative electrospray from m/z 70–1050 with a resolution of 140,000 (at m/z 200).

"	"Raw data was converted into an mzXML file format using ReadW (v4.0.2). The scans from negative and positive electrospray ionization were saved in two different files. Untargeted analysis for both ionization methods was done by using the open source R package XCMS44. XCMS parameters were optimized by the R-package IPO45. XCMS-data processing results in a data matrix which contains peak intensities (AUCs) from the negative and positive ionization mode. The peak intensities are called metabolic features, which are a unique combination of retention-time and median m/z ratio.
</p>
The order of the serum samples was randomized for analysis to avoid time-dependent bias. To exclude system-peaks (impurities in the measurement-system, visible in blanks) as well as poorly detected metabolic features, filter steps were performed based on QCs and BLs. A quantile regression approach was applied to correct time-dependent drifts, based on QC-intensities. Therefore, the R-function quant.reg was applied in two steps to achieve the requested drift correction 46,47. First based on the QC-intensities a model was built to configure the variation in time. The 50% quantile of the QC’s (y’s) was estimated via nonparametric quantile regression, using regression splines depending on the sample number (x’s). This procedure fit a piecewise cubic polynomial (breakpoints in the third derivative) with 16 knots (df) arranged at the 50% quantile of the x’s: rq (y ~ bs ( x, df = 16), tau = 0.5). Second, another quantile regression model was estimated to attune all samples using a multiplicative correction factor based on the median intensities of the original QC-intensities. After a successful drift correction, metabolic features were used for statistical analysis."	"Identified compounds were identified by accurate mass and retention time in comparison to reference standards.  Putatively annotated compounds were annotated by accurate mass comparison using freely available metabolite databases (HMDB, KEGG, Metlin)."
