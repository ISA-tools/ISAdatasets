Study Title	"Application of HPLC-PDA-MS metabolite profiling to investigate the effect of growth temperature and day length on blackcurrant fruit"
Study Description	"INTRODUCTION: Blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) is an excellent example of a “super fruit” with potential health benefits. Both genotype and cultivation environment are known to affect the chemical composition of blackcurrant, especially ascorbic acid and various phenolic compounds. Environmental conditions, like temperature, solar radiation and precipitation can also have significant impact on fruit chemical composition. The relevance of the study is further accentuated by the predicted and ongoing changes in global climate. </br> OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to provide new knowledge and a deeper understanding of the effects of post flowering environmental conditions, namely temperature and day length, on fruit quality and chemical composition of blackcurrant using an untargeted high performance liquid chromatography–photo diode array–mass spectrometry (HPLC–PDA–MS) metabolomics approach. </br> METHODS: A phytotron experiment with cultivation of single-stemmed potted plants of blackcurrant cv. Narve Viking was conducted using constant temperatures of 12, 18 or 24 °C and three different photoperiods (short day, short day with night interruption, and natural summer daylight conditions). Plants were also grown under ambient outdoor conditions. Ripe berries were analysed using an untargeted HPLC–PDA–MS metabolomics approach to detect the presence and concentration of molecules as affected by controlled climatic factors. </br> RESULTS: The untargeted metabolomics dataset contained a total of 7274 deconvolved retention time-m/z pairs across both electrospray ionisation (ESI) positive and negative polarities, from which 549 metabolites were identified or minimally annotated based upon accurate mass MS. Conventional principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with the Friedman significance test were applied to first identify which metabolites responded to temperature in a linear fashion. Multi-block hierarchical PCA in combination with the Friedman significance test was secondly applied to identify metabolites that were responsive to different day length conditions. Temperature had significant effect on a total of 365 metabolites representing a diverse range of chemical classes. It was observed that ripening of the blackcurrant berries under ambient conditions, compared to controlled conditions, resulted in an increased accumulation of 34 annotated metabolites, mainly anthocyanins and flavonoids. 18 metabolites were found to be regulated differentially under the different daylength conditions. Moreover, based upon the most abundant anthocyanins, a comparison between targeted and untargeted analyses, revealed a close convergence of the two analytical methods. Therefore, the study not just illustrates the value of non-targeted metabolomics approaches with respect to the huge diversity and numbers of significantly changed metabolites detected (and which would be missed by conventional targeted analyses), but also shows the validity of the non-targeted approach with respect to its precision compared to targeted analyses. </br> CONCLUSIONS: Blackcurrant maturation under controlled ambient conditions revealed a number of insightful relationships between environment and chemical composition of the fruit. A prominent reduction of the most abundant anthocyanins under the highest temperature treatments indicated that blackcurrant berries in general may accumulate lower total anthocyanins in years with extreme hot summer conditions. HPLC–PDA–MS metabolomics is an excellent method for broad analysis of chemical composition of berries rich in phenolic compounds. Moreover, the experiment in controlled phytotron conditions provided additional knowledge concerning plant interactions with the environment."

Study Protocol Description	"Raising and cultivation of blackcurrant plants (cultivar Narve Viking from the Norwegian breeding program) and the physical conditions during the experiment are explained in a previous publication[1]. 
</p>
In brief, following raising of blackcurrant plants under standardised controlled conditrions within the Polytron system, during the last 3 weeks of berry maturation, the plants were exposed to constant temperatures of 12, 18, and 24 °C (±1 °C) combined with the following photoperiodic conditions: (1) natural long summer day (LD 18 h), (2) 10 h artificial short day (SD), and (3) 10 h SD + 3 h night interruption (SD + NI). Both treatments 1 and 3 were perceived as long day conditions by the plants, but the former also provided a 9% larger daily light integral (total daily photosynthetic active radiation). On the other hand, by using low intensity incandescent lamps for the night interruption (approximately 7 μmol quanta/m^2/s), the daily light integral varied by less than 0.5% between treatments 2 and 3, which represent the true photoperiodic test. Plants were also grown outdoors in pots (as a control) under ambient summer conditions (59°40′N). 
</p>
Berries were harvested when fully ripe as judged by berry softness and visual assessment of colour. Berries from one cluster were harvested from the mid-part of 2 plants into a 50 ml tube and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. 
</p>
The experiment design was fully factorial with a split-plot design, with temperatures as main plots and photoperiod as a subplot. The experiment was replicated with 4 randomised blocks, each comprising 2 blackcurrant plants on a separate trolley, giving 8 plants per treatment.

Effects of controlled post-flowering temperature and daylength on chemical composition of four black currant (Ribes nigrum L.) cultivars of contrasting origin. doi:10.1016/j.scienta.2015.10.026.</br>"	"Freeze dried blackcurrant fruits were homogenised by pestle and mortar. 9 ml of extraction solvent (75% methanol:24.8% HPLC grade water:0.2% MS grade formic acid) was added to 300 mg (297-303 mg) of fruit and the sample vortex mixed for 15 s. The samples were next agitated for 30 min with a Heidolph multireax shaker set to speed 10 and centrifuged at 3220 x g for 10 min with an Eppendorf 5810R at 4000 rpm and 3 °C (rotor A-4-62). 
</p>
500 µl of supernatant was transferred to each of 2 x 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf Safe-Lock) per sample extract and dried by speed vacuum concentration at 30 °C for 6 h using the MiVac Duo concentrator system (S.P. Scientific, UK). Preparatory blank extracts were prepared identically, as were 12 extracts of Quality Control (QC) samples that contained an equal mix of all blackcurrant sample materials. 
</p>
Prior to HPLC-PDA-MS analysis, the first set of samples were reconstituted in 250 µl of 20% methanol:80% water containing 0.5 mM morin to serve as an internal standard, the samples were shaken for 30 min at 2000 rpm on an Ika Vibrax VXR shaker platform, and centrifuged for 10 min at 3 °C and at 18407 x g with an Eppendorf 5424R at 14000 rpm (rotor FA-45-24-11). The extract supernatants were next filtered with 0.45um PTFE filter vials (Thomson single step) and transferred to 2 ml HPLC vials with pre-slit caps (Thermo-Fisher, Chromacol 2SVW and 9-SCK(B)-ST1 X, respectively). The samples were stored in the autosampler at 10 °C and analysed within 48 h of reconstitution in positive electrospray ionisation (ESI) mode, after which the ESI source spray cone and ion tube were cleaned, the second set of samples were reconstituted and again analysed within 48 h of reconstitution in ESI negative mode."	"HPLC separations were performed with a Thermo Accela 600 HPLC system coupled with an Accela PDA detector (Thermo-Fisher Ltd. U.K). The HPLC was operated at a flow rate of 300 µl/min, the column and guard column (Synergi C18 Hydro-RP 80 A, 150 x 2.0 mm, 4 µm particle size; Phenomenex Ltd.) were maintained at a temperature of 30 °C. The solvent A, HPLC grade water, and solvent B, HPLC grade acetonitrile, were acidified with 0.1% [v/v] MS grade formic acid. A sample injection volume of 10 µl was employed in full-loop mode. 
</p>
The gradient programme was as follows: hold 2% B 0-2 min, 2-5% B 2-5 min, 5-45% B 5-25 min, 45-100% B 25-26 min, hold 100% B 26-29 min, 100–2% B 26-30 min, hold 2% B 30-35 min. Autosampler syringe and line washes were performed with 8:2 acetonitrile:water. 
</p>
The HPLC column eluent was first monitored by the Accela PDA detector where spectra were collected in wavelength/absorbance mode from 200-600 nm with a filter bandwidth and wavelength step of 1 nm, the filter rise time was 1 s, the sample rate was 5 Hz. Additionally three channel set points were employed, Channel A 280 nm, Channel B 365 nm, Channel C 520 nm, with a bandwidth of 9 nm and a sample rate of 10 Hz."	"The PDA detector eluent was next transfered to a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometry system operated under Xcalibur software (Thermo-Fisher Ltd. UK). Mass spectra were primarily collected in full scan mode (m/z 100-2000) at a mass resolution of 30,000 (FWHM defined at m/z 400) within the FT detector for all samples. 
</p>
2 further methods were applied to obtain ion trees by performing data-dependent analysis (DDA) at MS2 and MS3 levels for the mixed QA samples.  
</p>
The first method applied a primary full scan event within the FT, followed by a secondary scan event within the LTQ-IT to collect MS2 CID fragmentation spectra for the top 3 most intense ions as defined within the preliminary full MS scan. 
</p>
The second method was identical, but applied a further tertiary MS scan event where the top 3 most intense ions detected in each MS2 spectrum, were taken forward for further CID fragmentation and MS3 collection within the LTQ-IT. 
</p>
Helium was applied as a collision gas for CID at a normalised collision energy of 45%, a trapping window width of 2 (+/- 1) m/z was applied, an activation time of 30 ms and activation Q of 0.25 were applied, only singly charged ions were selected for DDA, isotopic ions were also excluded. 
</p>
The preliminary full scan event within the FT generated 'profile' mode spectral data, whereas the LTQ-IT MS2 and MS3 data were collected in ‘centroid’ mode. To obtain MS2 and MS3 data for as broad range of ions as possible, the DDA MS2 and MS3 methods can be applied several times over restricted mass ranges (e.g. 100-500 m/z; 500-1000 m/z;1000-2000 m/z). 
</p>
A scan speed of 0.1 s and 0.4 s were apllied in the LTQ-IT and FT-MS respectively. The Automatic Gain Control was set to 1 x 10^5 and 1 x 10^6 for the LTQ-IT and FT-MS respectively. 
</p>
Prior to the analytical run the LTQ-IT and FT-MS were calibrated with the manufacturers recomended calibration mixture and procedures. 
</p>
The following settings were applied to ESI: Spray voltage -3.5 kV (ESI-) and +4.5 kV (ESI+); Sheath gas 60; Aux gas 30; Capilary voltage -35 V (ESI-) +35 V (ESI+); Tube lens voltage -100 V (ESI-) and +100 V (ESI+); Capilary temperture 280 °C; ESI probe temperature 100 °C. 
</p>
For the first 2 minutes of analysis the eluent flow was directed to waste, whereas from 2-29 min the eluent was directed to the MS detector, before being directed back to waste between 29-35 min. 
</p>
The samples were analysed in a completely randomised order as 2 independent analytical blocks respective of ESI positive and ESI negative polarities. For each analytical block, initially 8 injections of QA sample were performed for LC-MS system conditioning, after which 3 further injections of QA sample were performed, followed by 5-6 injections of experimental samples and a further QA injection. This was repeated until all samples were analysed, finally the analytical block was concluded with a further 2 QA injections. A control blank sample was analysed at the start and end of the analytical block, which was finally concluded by collection of the DDA MS2 and MS3 profiles."	"The HPLC-PDA-MS raw data profiles were first converted into an mzML centroid format within the Proteowizard (http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/) MSConvert software package. Each mzML based 3D data matrix (intensity x m/z x time – 1 per sample) was converted (or deconvolved) into a vector of peak responses, where a peak response is defined as the sum of intensities over a window of specified mass and time range (e.g. m/z = 102.1 ± 0.01 and time = 130 ± 10 s). 
</p>
In this experiment the deconvolution was performed using the freely available XCMS online package (https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/). 
</p>
XCMS online was operated with the following parameter set points: Feature detection; method – CentWave; mass error 5 ppm, minimum and maximum peak width 10 and 60 s respectively, mzdiff 0.01, S/N threshold 6, integration method 1, prefilter peaks 3, prefilter intensity 50,000, noise filter 100,000: RT correction; method – Obiwarp, profstep 1: Alignment; minfrac 0.5, mz width 0.015, bw 5, min samp 1, max samp 100: Annotation; Search for isotopes+adducts, mz absolute error 0.015, ppm error 5."	"Annotation and identification of each detected RT-m/z pair was performed by applying a set of workflows known as PutMedID[1][2]. Metabolite identifications were primarily made based upon the accurate mass full MS data applying a library of known plant metabolites obtained from the Plant Metabolic Network PlantCyc database (http://www.plantcyc.org) in addition to the Manchester Metabolomics Database (MMD: http://dbkgroup.org/MMD/).
</p>
Further to performing accurate mass based annotation, the molecular formulae presented for each feature were additionally validated based upon an isotopic peak ratio check performed manually within Xcalibur.
</p>
The PDA absorbance was also checked against available literature and an inhouse database of soft fruit phenolic compounds, the MS2 and MS3 fragmentation spectra were also matched to the inhouse database of soft fruit phenolic compounds.
</p>
Where reference standards were available, HPLC RT, High Resolution (HR)MS accurate mass, MS2 and MS3 spectra, were all matched to those of the sample extracts, thus providing an MSI level 1 identification[3]. 
</p>
Where MS2 and MS3 data were not captured for a given blackcurrant metabolite within this studies sample set, MS2 and MS3 data acquired with previous blackcurrant sample populations, where available, were alternatively considered.
</p>
Where an RT-m/z pair was matched to multiple molecular formulae, or a single molecular formula, but matched to multiple metabolites, an MSI Level 3 identification was attributed. 
</p>
Where a RT-m/z pair was matched to a single molecular formula and metabolite, an MSI Level 2 identification was attributed. If in addition, MS2 and MS3 data matched those available within the Mass Bank European database (when reference standards were unavailable), then the RT-m/z pair was attributed a MSI Level 2+ identification. Where PDA absorbance and HPLC RT information complimiented that available in the literature, MSI Level 2 and 2+ identifications were considered as high confidence. 
</p>
Unknown peaks were attributed an MSI Level 4 identification.
