Study Title	"Metabolites from surface seawater collected in Narragansett Bay"
Study Description	"In aquatic environments, the production and consumption of organic compounds is directly tied to the metabolic potential of the in situ microbial community. The community’s metabolic potential can be assessed using metatranscriptomics, which is a measure of gene expression in the environment. More recently, advances in metabolomics deliver details on specific organic compounds found in the environment. While the integration of these two datasets is desirable, the vast data streams can hinder investigations into biological and chemical processes. Here, we use data in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) combined with K means clustering to jointly interrogate metabolomics and metatranscriptomics data collected from a coastal marine environment. Using KEGG allowed us to focus our analysis on genes and compounds connected by a defined biochemical reaction. The K means clustering provided an unbiased means to place metabolites and genes into groups based on their temporal variability. Each of the groups defined by the K means clustering contained both transcripts and metabolites, which emphasized the interconnected nature of these two datasets. While conceptually simple, this analysis allowed us to explore a tractable number of biochemical pathways within our data. Continued development of computational tools to analyze meta-omics data is a pressing need. The application of tools such as described here is an exciting step towards integrated multi-omics data analysis that can be used to address broad questions in biogeochemical cycling."

Study Protocol Description	"Surface seawater was collected and filtered from Narragansett Bay (41°34'12'' N, 71°23'24'' W) on five different days in 2012 (May 16, May 21, May 30, June 4, June 8; [1]). Each water sample was 2 l and triplicate water samples were processed at each time point. The seawater was filtered through 5 µm polycarbonate filters and the filters were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

PMID:25870299</br>"	"The intracellular metabolites were extracted using a method modified from a protocol described by [1]. Briefly, the filter was extracted three times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and dried in a vacufuge.
</p>
The samples for the targeted mass spectrometry analysis were re-dissolved in 90:10 (v/v) water:acetonitrile and combined with deuterated biotin (final concentration 0.05 µg/ml) as an internal standard.
</p>
For untargeted analysis, the extracts had to undergo an additional de-salting step prior to analysis. Therefore, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and extracted using a 50 mg/1 cc PPL cartridge following the protocol of [2]. The resulting methanol extracts were re-dissolved in 95:5 water:acetonitrile.

The chromatography gradient was: an initial hold of 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water) : 5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 2 min, ramp to 65% B from 2 to 20 min, ramp to 100% B from 20 to 25 min, and hold until 32.5 min. The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min between samples with solvent A. Each metabolite was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with optimal parameters determined from infusion of authentic standards. Eight-point external calibration curves (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng/ml) were generated for each compound by plotting peak area against concentration.
</p>
For untargeted metabolomics analysis, LC separation was performed using a Synergi Fusion reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with the same gradient as for targeted analysis."	"For targeted analysis, samples were analyzed with a Thermo Scientific TSQ Vantage Triple Stage Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. This instrument allows polarity switching between positive and negative ion mode within a single LC run. Analysis of authentic standards was used to determine the optimal ionization mode for each metabolite.
</p>
For untargeted analysis, samples were analyzed in both negative and positive ion mode with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled by electrospray ionization to a 7-Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). In parallel to the FT acquisition, four data dependent MS/MS scans were collected at nominal mass resolution in the ion trap (LTQ). Samples were analyzed in random order with a pooled sampled run every six samples in order to assess instrument variability."	"Targeted metabolomics data The resulting data were converted to mzML files using the msConvert tool [1] and processed with MAVEN [2]. The concentration of the metabolites in the targeted mass spectrometry data is given in ng/ml. Note that the concentration of these metabolites in the cell-free controls has been subtracted from the corresponding treatment with Thalassiosira.
</p>
Untargeted metabolomics data Data were collected as XCalibur RAW files which were converted to mzXML files using the msConvert tool within ProteoWizard [1]. Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS [3], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm [4], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps. CAMERA was used 1) to find compounds differing by adduct ion and stable isotope composition [5] and 2) to extract the intensities and m/z values for the associated MS/MS spectra.
