Study Identifier	"MTBLS471"
Study Title	"Imaging with Mass Spectrometry of Bacteria on the Exoskeleton of Fungus-Growing Ants"
Study Description	"Mass spectrometry imaging is a powerful analytical technique for detecting and determining spatial distributions of molecules within a sample. Typically, mass spectrometry imaging is limited to the analysis of thin tissue sections taken from the middle of a sample. In this work, we present a mass spectrometry imaging method for the detection of compounds produced by bacteria on the outside surface of ant exoskeletons in response to pathogen exposure. Fungus-growing ants have a specialized mutualism with Pseudonocardia, a bacterium that lives on the ants’ exoskeletons and helps protect their fungal garden food source from harmful pathogens. The developed method allows for visualization of bacterial-derived compounds on the ant exoskeleton. This method demonstrates the capability to detect compounds that are specifically localized to the bacterial patch on ant exoskeletons, shows good reproducibility across individual ants, and achieves accurate mass measurements within 5 ppm error when using a high-resolution, accurate-mass mass spectrometer."

Study Protocol Description	"Acromyrmex octospinosus leaf-cutter ants were collected in the Canal Zone in Panama (colony ST040116-01). Subcolonies of ants were made by placing approximately 1 g of fungus garden in a Petri plate followed by 4 major workers from the main fungus garden. Additional subcolonies were made to raise workers that were symbiont (Pseudonocardia)-free. The subcolonies and ants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: Pseudonocardia/pathogen treatment, no-Pseudoncoardia/pathogen treatment, or a Pseudonocardia/control treatment. Pathogen-treated subcolonies were inoculated with the fungus Escovopsis. Control subcolonies were similarly inoculated with a sterile inoculation loop. Subcolonies were left for 20 hr after which focal ants were removed and frozen at -20 °C for further processing.
</p>
The ants were dissected by removing the head, abdomen, and appendages from the thorax with a razor blade. The thorax was placed in the groove of the slide with additional tape over the bottom portion of the thorax (posterior to the Pseudonocardia patch on the propleural plate) to secure into place. Ant thoraxes were then inlaid into the groove of the slide with the propleural plate facing outward and parallel with the top of the slide."	"7 ants with Pseudonocardia without garden infection (un-exposed) and 7 ants with Pseudonocardia exposed to the pathogen Escovopsis were used for metabolite extractions. The 7 propleural plates were detached from the ants, placed into a pre-chilled mortar, flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and ground to powder. The powder was transferred to a pre-chilled 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The metabolites were extracted with 3:1:4 methanol:chloroform:water (v/v/v), briefly vortexed, and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 x g. The resulting aqueous supernatant was removed and collected in new tubes. An additional 4 parts methanol was added to the tubes with the remaining organic and protein layers. The tubes were vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 x g to pellet the protein layer. The organic layer was removed and collected in new tubes. Both the aqueous and organic fractions were dried and concentrated via SpeedVac and stored at -80 °C until analysis."	"Propleural plate extracts were resuspended in 40 μl of either water + 0.1% formic acid (FA) (aqueous fractions) or acetonitrile (AcN) + 0.1% FA (organic fractions). Samples were separated on a Kinetix C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 1.7-μm particle size; Phenomenex), equipped with a corresponding guard column, and heated to 35 °C. Mobile phases were (A) water with 0.1% FA and (B) AcN with 0.1% FA. Aqueous fractions were separated within 35 min under the following conditions: 0-5 min, 1% B; 5-10 min, 1-3% B; 10-18 min, 3-40% B; 18-22 min, 40-80% B; column cleaning at 95% B for 5 min and system re-equilibration at 1% B for 8 min. Organic fractions were separated within 35 min under the following conditions: 0-22 min, 1-95% B; column cleaning at 95% B for 5 min and re-equilibration at 1% B for 8 min. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min and the injection volume was 5 μl. The samples were kept at 10 °C during the analysis."	"MS and MS/MS data were acquired on a quadrupole-orbital trapping instrument (Q-Exactive Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific) equipped with an ESI source operated in positive ion mode. The MS scan range was m/z 135–1300. The MS/MS scan range was adjusted depending on the parent mass and high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) was used for fragmentation with collision energy of 35 eV and an isolation width of 3 Da."	"No data transformation information was uploaded for this study."	"Online databases were used to search the accurate mass and MS/MS data for potential metabolite identifications. Several adducts were searched for each parent mass, including: [M+H], [M+], [M+Na], and [M+K] within 5 ppm mass error. Ergothioneine was identified by searching the accurate mass and MS/MS data against reference MS/MS spectra in the METLIN database[1] and then comparing the LC retention time and MS/MS spectra to a purchased ergothioneine standard.
