Study Title	"The Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase inhibitor Veliparib and Radiation Cause Significant Cell Line Dependent Metabolic Changes in Breast Cancer Cells"
Study Description	"Breast tumors are characterized into different subtypes based on their surface marker expression, which affects their prognosis and treatment. For example, triple negative breast cancer cells (ER-/PR-/Her2-) show reduced susceptibility towards radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic agents. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have shown promising results in clinical trials, both as single agents and in combination with other chemotherapeutics, in several subtypes of breast cancer patients. PARP1 is involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation and an understanding of the effects of PARP inhibitors, specifically on metabolism, is currently lacking. Here, we have used NMR-based metabolomics to probe the cell line-specific effects of PARP inhibitor and radiation on metabolism in three distinct breast cancer cell lines. Our data reveal several cell line independent metabolic changes upon PARP inhibition, including an increase in taurine. Pathway enrichment and topology analysis identified that nitrogen metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism were enriched after PARP inhibition in the three breast cancer cell lines. We observed that the majority of metabolic changes due to radiation as well as PARP inhibition were cell line dependent, highlighting the need to understand how these treatments affect cancer cell response via changes in metabolism. Finally, we observed that both PARP inhibition and radiation induced a similar metabolic response in the HCC1937 (BRCA mutant cell line), but not in MCF-7 and MDAMB231 cells, suggesting that radiation and PARP inhibition share similar interactions with metabolic pathways in BRCA mutant cells. Our study emphasizes the importance of differences in metabolic responses to cancer treatments in different subtypes of cancers."

Study Protocol Description	"NMR sample collection was performed as follows. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and then the cells were quenched using 3 ml methanol as it gives better extraction efficiency and provides rapid quenching as compared to other methods. The cells were then detached using a cell scraper and pipetted into a 50 ml centrifuge tube."	"The quenched cells were suspended in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water (6:6:5.4) to make a final volume of 17.4 ml. After centrifugation for 15 min at 3600 rpm, the upper aqueous layer was used for further analysis and the organic phase was discarded. The samples were dried at 30 °C using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator and stored at -80 °C until NMR analysis. "	"Prior to NMR analysis, the samples were reconstituted in 0.6 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffered D2O (pH=7.0) solution containing 0.5 mM 3-trimethylsilyl-propionate-2, 2, 3, 3,-d4 (TMSP, δ=0.0 ppm) as an internal standard and 0.2% w/v sodium azide. The samples were centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 10 min and 550 µl of the supernatant was transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes (Norell Inc.). The NMR analysis was carried out at 25 °C."	"1H NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III equipped with a 5 mm cryogenic probe operating at 500 MHz (11.74 T). "	"1D spectra were acquired using standard NOESYPR1D pulse sequence (RD-90°-t1-90°-tm-90°-acquire) with a relaxation delay of 1 s, a mixing time of 100 ms and a pre-scan delay of 30 µs. Each spectrum consisted of 128 transients or free induction decays (FIDs) collected into 48,000 complex data points with a spectral width of 12 ppm and an acquisition time of 4 s. Prior to Fourier transformation, the FIDs were zero-filled to 128,000 data points and multiplied by an exponential window function (LB =0.5 Hz). The chemical shifts were referenced to the TMSP peak (δ=0 ppm), using TopSpinTM software (version 3.1, Bruker)."	"Spectra were exported to an ACD/1D NMR Processor (Advanced Chemistry Development) for phasing, baseline correction, and solvent region removal (water: 4.7-5.1 ppm and DMSO: 2.72-2.75 ppm). "	"The peaks were annotated through the HMDB [1] and Metabohunter [2] and targeted profiling [3] was accomplished using ChenomX NMR Suite Profiler (version 7.7, ChenomX Inc.).  The concentrations were referenced to a TMSP concentration of 0.5 mM. Over 95% of the peaks were assigned to metabolites available in the ChenomX library and the quantified metabolite concentrations were exported to an Excel file. Metabolites with sample to sample variation (within replicates) which had a coefficient of variance higher than 0.3 were excluded from the analysis. These included acetate, citrate, guanidoacetate, isobutyrate, and malate, the majority of which are low confidence metabolites, generally present at very low concentrations and in regions with high overlap of peaks. The concentration data matrix was further normalized by the total concentration of metabolites in each sample to evaluate the metabolite fractions and also to account for the differences in efficiencies of extraction.</br>
