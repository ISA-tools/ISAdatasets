Study Title	"Absolute quantification of metabolites in tomato fruit extracts by fast 2D NMR (Calibration Standard 500 MHz samples)"
Study Description	"Quantitative NMR metabolomics is a powerful tool to have access to valuable information on metabolism. Unfortunately, the quantitative analysis of metabolic samples is often hampered by peak overlap. Two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy offers a promising alternative and quantitative results can be obtained provided that a calibration approach is employed. However, the duration of 2D NMR experiments is barely compatible with the metabolomic study of a large number of samples. This drawback can be circumvented by relying on “ultrafast” experiments capable of recording 2D spectra in a single-scan. While such experiments are not sensitive enough to match the concentrations of metabolic samples, a compromise can be reached by hybrid strategies capable of recording 2D NMR spectra of extracts in a few minutes only. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that these multi-scan single-shot experiments can be successfully applied to the absolute quantification of major metabolites in plant extracts. Fast COSY experiments are recorded in 5 min on tomato fruit pericarp extracts at different stages of development. The concentration of eight major metabolites is determined with a trueness better than 10 % and a technical repeatability of a few percent. The experiments performed at two magnetic fields lead to similar quantitative results, in coherence with the metabolism of tomato fruit. The results show that fast 2D NMR methods form a promising tool for fast targeted metabolomics, and open promising perspective towards the automated and high-throughput quantitative analysis of large groups of plant and other samples for metabolomics and for the modelling of metabolism.</p>NMR Calibration Standard corresponding to the MTBLS131 datasets."

Study Protocol Description	"Reference standards were commercially purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and prepared in-house."	"The particularity of 2D NMR for quantitative analysis is that the peak volumes depend on several factors in addition to the concentration. Building a calibration curve for each targeted metabolite is therefore indispensable—still, a single series of calibration samples containing all the targeted metabolites together is sufficient, and better reflects the complexity of the extracts. For this purpose, five calibration samples containing eight targeted metabolites at different concentrations were prepared in the phosphate buffer solution used to prepare the fruit extracts. The values of these concentrations (see Supplementary Table S2 in the paper associated with this study) were determined from previous profiling studies performed on tomato pericarp [1][2]. To keep a similar ionic force across the calibration range, the changes in the concentrations of these eight metabolites were not uniform.
</p>
As with the fruit extracts reported in MTBLS131 and MTBLS132, the calibration samples were also titrated with KOD to pH 6 using a titration unit BTpH (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) in 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution in D2O containing 2 mM EDTA. Then, trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate sodium salt (TSP, 0.01% final concentration for chemical shift calibration) was added. Titrated extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized during 12 h.

"All the NMR spectra of the calibration samples were recorded three times at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III 500 spectrometer, operating at a frequency of 500.13 MHz with a dual 5 mm cryogenically cooled 1H-13C probe."	"For each experiment, the 90° pulse width was carefully calibrated and the water signal at 4.7 ppm was presaturated by continuous irradiation during the recovery delay. All experiments by ultrafast NMR were performed under partial saturation conditions, with TR = 5 s. All the ultrafast COSY experiments were recorded using the pulse sequence described previously [1], including the possibility to perform interleaved acquisitions. The final spectral width was 4.5 ppm in both dimensions at 500 MHz. The experiment duration is given by Ta = NS•N1 where NS is the number of scans and N1 the number of interleaved acquisitions. For the experiments performed at 500 MHz, the following parameters were used: NS = 64 and N1 = 1, as interleaving was not needed to sample the relevant spectral width. All the experiments were eventually performed with a ca. 5 min overall duration. For all the experiments, the spatial encoding was performed with two successive smoothed chirp pulses (60 kHz, 15 ms) applied together with 8.3 G/cm bipolar spatial encoding gradients. The mixing period included opposite coherence-selection gradients (sin shape; 58.5 G/cm, 0.8 ms). For the acquisition, 128 acquisition gradient pairs were applied, with the following amplitude and duration: 58.5 G/cm and 256 µs. The amplitude and duration of the pre-acquisition gradient were adapted to center the chemical shift range of interest in the middle of the detection window in the spatially encoded dimension.

A sinebell function was applied in the conventional dimension of all the experiments. In the ultrafast dimension, an apodization was performed in the spatial dimension with optimized gaussian apodization functions designed according to a recently described procedure [1]. The conventional spectra were zero-filled in both dimensions and the ultrafast spectra were zero-filled in the conventional dimension.
</p>
All the spectra were processed in the magnitude mode. Finally, a second order automatic baseline correction was applied in the two dimensions of the 2D spectra.
The specific processing for the ultrafast spectra (as described in [2]) was performed using a home-written routine in TopSpin (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany. All the pulse sequences and processing programs described in this paper are available on request.

After annotation, the most isolated peak was selected for each compound. The peak volumes were measured using the 2D integration tool in TopSpin 3.1 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). The integration region limits were optimized for each peak of interest on the highest concentrated mixture. Integration regions were centered on the peak of interest and their size was chosen as large as possible to integrate the whole peak but small enough to avoid overlap with neighbouring peaks. Identical integration regions were used for all the samples.
</p>
To evaluate the repeatability of the NMR quantification procedure, each spectrum (calibration and biological extracts) was acquired three successive times, and average values were calculated for each peak volume. Calibration curves were then fitted by the linear regression equation: V = a•[m] + b, where V represents the 2D peak volume (arbitrary unit, a.u.) and [m] is the concentration (in millimoles per litre) of the given metabolite in the calibration sample.
</p>
To determine the unknown concentration of the eight metabolites in the twelve tomato pericarp extracts, the volume of each target peak was measured with the same integration file as for the calibration samples, and the concentration was determined using the linear regression equation of the corresponding metabolite. (Tomato extract samples available at MTBLS131)."
