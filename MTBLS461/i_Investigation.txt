Study Title	"Intracellular metabolites from an experimental manipulation of marine microorganisms"
Study Description	"The marine environment holds one of the largest pools of reduced organic carbon on Earth. Within this organic carbon are metabolites produced as a result of microbial activity. This project considers the effects of predation and viral lysis on the metabolites found in the surface ocean. Using seawater from the surface ocean, we experimentally manipulated levels of predation and viral lysis. At the beginning and end of the experiment, we sampled the intracellular and extracellular metabolites. The extracts were analyzed using liquid chromatography-based targeted and untargeted metabolomics methods that we have modified for use with marine samples. The untargeted metabolomics data revealed a complex mixture of organic compounds in all of the experimental treatments. However, changes in the majority of the features could not be linked to viral lysis or predation. Within the targeted metabolomics data, increased intracellular levels of osmolytes (glycine betaine, dimethylsulfoniopropionate, proline, and ectoine) were observed under conditions with limited grazing or viral lysis. The molecular insights derived here will explicitly inform our understanding of microbial processes in the surface ocean and the subsequent impacts on the global carbon cycle."

Study Protocol Description	"Seawater for the incubation experiments was collected using 10 l Niskin bottles attached to a CTD/rosette system. Seawater was collected off the northeastern corner of South America at 9.75º N, 55.3º W from 70 m. Silicone tubing was used to collect water from the Niskins and the tubing was placed in the bottom of polycarbonate carboys in order to minimize turbulence during sample collection. The seawater was first filtered through a 0.2 µm Sterivex (Millipore) to obtain cell-free seawater. To obtain cell- and virus-free seawater, tangential flow filtration using a recirculating Prep/Scale tangential flow ultrafilter (Millipore) with a 30 kDa molecular mass cut-off was used.
</p>
5 different experimental treatments were established: 1) a whole seawater control, 2) 20% whole seawater with cell-free seawater, 3) 45% whole seawater with cell-free seawater, 4) 20% whole seawater with cell- and virus-free seawater, 5) 45% whole seawater with cell- and virus-free seawater. There were 3 x 2 l polycarbonate bottles established for each treatment. Each bottle held 2320 ml of fluid. 1 of the bottles was sampled immediately after the experiment was set up. The 2 remaining bottles were incubated for 1 day in an on-deck, flow-through incubator that allowed 10% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to pass through its screening."	"The intracellular metabolites were extracted using a method modified from a previously desbribed protocol[1]. Briefly, the filter was extracted 3 times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and dried in a vacufuge.
</p>
The samples for the targeted mass spectrometry analysis were re-dissolved in 95:5 (v/v) water:acetonitrile and combined with deuterated biotin (final concentration 0.05 µg/ml) as an internal standard. The final extract volume was 100 µl.
</p>
For untargeted analysis, the extracts had to undergo an additional de-salting step prior to analysis. Therefore, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and extracted using a 50 mg/1 cc PPL cartridge following a previously established protocol[2]. The resulting methanol extracts were re-dissolved in 95:5 water:acetonitrile and deuterated biotin.

The chromatography gradient was: an initial hold of 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water):5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 2 min, ramp to 65% B from 2 to 20 min, ramp to 100% B from 20 to 25 min, and hold until 32.5 min. The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min between samples with solvent A. Each metabolite was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with optimal parameters determined from infusion of authentic standards. 10-point external calibration curves (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 ng/ml) were generated for each compound by plotting peak area against concentration. 
</p>
For untargeted metabolomics analysis, LC separation was performed using a Synergi Fusion reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with the same gradient as for targeted analysis."	"For targeted analysis, samples were analyzed with a Thermo Scientific TSQ Vantage Triple Stage Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. This instrument allows polarity switching between positive and negative ion mode within a single LC run. Analysis of authentic standards was used to determine the optimal ionization mode for each metabolite.
</p>
For untargeted analysis, samples were analyzed in negative ion mode with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled by electrospray ionization to a 7-Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). In parallel to the FT acquisition, 4 data dependent MS/MS scans were collected at nominal mass resolution in the ion trap (LTQ). Samples were analyzed in random order with a pooled sampled run every 6 samples in order to assess instrument variability."	"Targeted metabolomics data: The resulting data were converted to mzML files using the msConvert tool[1] and processed with MAVEN[2]. The concentration of the metabolites in the targeted mass spectrometry data is given in ng/ml. 
</p>
Untargeted metabolomics data were collected as XCalibur RAW files which were converted to mzXML files using the msConvert tool within ProteoWizard[1]. Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS[3], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm[4], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps. CAMERA was used 1) to find compounds differing by adduct ion and stable isotope composition[5] and 2) to extract the intensities and m/z values for the associated MS/MS spectra.
