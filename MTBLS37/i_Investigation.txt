Study Protocol Description	"Liquid cultures of C. reinhardtii wild-type (WT) cc406 and mutant strain Stm6Glc4[1] were grown in Tris acetate phosphate medium under continuous illumination (40 µmol/m2/s white light, measured with a QSL 2100 laboratory radiometer (Biospherical Instruments Inc.)). The WT cc406 was selected as reference strain, because Stm6Glc4 originated from a similar genetic background. For H2 production experiments, cultures were grown under continuous illumination in Tris acetate phosphate medium until they reached the late logarithmic growth phase. After changing the medium (triplicate washes with sulfur-depleted Tris acetate phosphate medium followed by centrifugation at 2,500 x g, 4 min, 20 °C), the cultures were adjusted to ~1.2 x 107 cells per ml (~27 µg of chlorophyll/ml) and supplemented with 1 mM glucose for optimal H2 production in Stm6Glc4. The gas-tight bioreactors were then illuminated with continuous light (300µmol/m2/s) for up to 120 h. H2 Measurement—H2 production was determined volumetrically, and the gas quality was measured via gas chromatography as described in a previous study [1].
</p>
Chlorophyll Fluorescence Measurements:</br>
Chlorophyll a fluorescence yields were determined at room temperature (Mini- PAM, Walz, Germany). Photosynthetic quantum yield (Phi PSII) was determined by illuminating cell suspensions with actinic white light (300 µmol/m2/s, saturation pulse of 15,000 µmol/m2/s). Fluorescence parameters were recorded, and quantum yield was calculated (Phi PSII = (F'_m - F_t)/F'_m) and recorded every 2 h.

PMID:17624461</br>"	"Algal culture samples (30 ml) were removed from the bioreactor sideport with a syringe and harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 1 min and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. 200 µl of the supernatant was also frozen in liquid nitrogen and later used for determination of fermentative products (see below). 1 ml of 80% methanol containing 10 µM ribitol (internal standard) and 500 mg of silica beads (0.1-mm diameter, Roth) were added to 10 mg of freeze-dried cells. Cells were disrupted with a Precellys homogenizer (3 times at 6,500 rpm for 45 s, Peqlab) and centrifuged at 14,500 rpm for 20 min. 700 µl of the supernatant was then dried under a nitrogen stream. The samples were incubated with 100 µl of methoxylamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in pyridine (20 mg/ml) for 90 min at 37 °C while stirring. N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (Macherey & Nagel) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C while stirring."	"GCxGC-TOF-MS analysis was performed using a LECO (St. Joseph, MI) Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The Pegasus 4D system was equipped with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph. The following instrument settings were used for analysis. The inlet temperature was set to 275 °C. A 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm film thickness, Rtx-5ms (Restek Corp.), capillary column was used as the primary column. The secondary column was a BPX-50 (SGE) 2 m x 0.1 mm x 0.1 µm capillary column. The temperature program of the primary oven was set to the following conditions: 70 °C for 2 min, 4 °C/min to 180 °C, 2 °C/min to 230 °C, and 4 °C/min to 325 °C, held for 3 min. The secondary oven was programmed with an offset of 15 °C to the primary oven temperature. The thermal modulator was set at 30 °C relative to primary oven and with a modulation time of 5 s and a hot pulse time of 0.4 s."	"GCxGC-TOF-MS analysis was performed using a LECO (St. Joseph, MI) Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer ion source temperature was set at 200 °C, and the ionization was performed at -70 eV. The detector voltage was 1600 V, and the stored mass range was 50–750 m/z with an acquisition rate of 200 spectra/s."	"The samples were processed automatically by the LECO ChromaTOF software v.4.22 (LECO, St. Joseph, MI) at a signal to noise (S/N) ratio of 100. The baseline offset was 0.8 and the two peak widths were set to 0.2 s (as measured from baseline to baseline) and 15 s (first dimension). The background peaks originating from the column bleed or solvent tailing were eliminated by the processing method by using the classification feature of the software."	"Analytes were identified by database searches using the Golm Metabolite Database GMD (version 20100614) metabolite library. The minimum required similarity threshold for assignment of a compound name was set to 600. All peaks with best matching library spectrum similarity below 600, flagged as Unknown, were removed from further consideration."
