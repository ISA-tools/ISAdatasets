Study Title	"Lipin1 deficiency causes sarcoplasmic reticulum stress and chaperone-responsive myopathy."
Study Description	"As a consequence of impaired glucose or fatty acid metabolism, bioenergetic stress in skeletal muscles may trigger myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Genetic mutations causing loss of function of the LPIN1 gene frequently lead to severe rhabdomyolysis bouts in children, though the metabolic alterations and possible therapeutic interventions remain elusive. Here, we show that lipin1 deficiency in mouse skeletal muscles is sufficient to trigger myopathy. Strikingly, muscle fibers display strong accumulation of both neutral and phospholipids. The metabolic lipid imbalance can be traced to an altered fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation, accompanied by a defect in acyl chain elongation and desaturation. As an underlying cause, we reveal a severe sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stress, leading to the activation of the lipogenic SREBP1c/SREBP2 factors, the accumulation of the Fgf21 cytokine, and alterations of SR-mitochondria morphology. Importantly, pharmacological treatments with the chaperone TUDCA and the fatty acid oxidation activator bezafibrate improve muscle histology and strength of lipin1 mutants. Our data reveal that SR stress and alterations in SR-mitochondria contacts are contributing factors and potential intervention targets of the myopathy associated with lipin1 deficiency."

Study Protocol Description	"Mice gastrocnemius muscle were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C before the extraction."	"Frozen muscle tissue samples were powdered using Mikro-Dismembrator S (Sartorius) according to manufactures instructions. Metabolites were extracted as previously described[1]. Briefly 30 mg of frozen powdered muscle tissue was used for extraction. Extraction solution was composed of 50% methanol, 30% ACN, and 20% water. The volume of extraction solution added was adjusted to mass of the tissue (1 ml/100 mg). After addition of extraction solution, samples were vortexed for 5 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and stored at -80 °C until analyses.

PMID:26358905</br>"	"LC/MS analyses were conducted on a QExactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo, USA). 5 μl of each sample was injected onto Zic-pHilic (150 mm x 2.1 mm i.d. 5 μm) with the guard column (20 mm x 2.1 mm i.d. 5 μm) (Millipore) for the liquid chromatography separation. Buffer A was 20 mM ammonium carbonate, 0.1% ammonium hydroxide (pH 9.2); buffer B was acetonitrile. The chromatographic gradient was run at a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min as follows: 0–20 min.: linear gradient from 80% to 20% B; 20–20.5 min.: linear gradient from 20% to 80% B; 20.5–28 min.: hold at 80% B[1].

PMID:26358905</br>"	"Mass spectrometry analyses were conducted on a QExactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with an Ion Max source and a HESI II probe. External mass calibration was performed using the standard calibration mixture every 7 days as recommended by the manufacturer.  The mass spectrometer was operated in full-scan, polarity switching mode with the spray voltage set to 2.5 kV, the heated capillary held at 320 °C. The sheath gas flow was set to 20 units, the auxiliary gas flow was set to 5 units, and the sweep gas flow was set to 0 unit. The metabolites were detected across a mass range of 75–1,000 m/z at a resolution of 35,000 (at 200 m/z) with the AGC target at 106, and the maximum injection time at 250 ms. Lock masses were used to insure mass accuracy below 5 ppm. Data were acquired with Thermo Xcalibur software."	"Data was collected as RAW data and not transformed into another format."	"The peak areas of metabolites were determined using Thermo TraceFinder software, identified by the exact mass of each singly charged ion and by known retention time on the HPLC column. Statistical and pathway analyses were performed using Metaboanalyst 4.0 software[1].
