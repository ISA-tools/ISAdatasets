Study Title	"Dissolved organic carbon compounds in deep-sea hydrothermal vent fluids"
Study Description	"Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are unique ecosystems that may provide chemically distinct dissolved organic matter to the deep ocean. Here, we describe the types and concentrations of polar dissolved organic compounds observed at low and high temperature hydrothermal vents at 9°50’N, the East Pacific Rise. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon was 46 µM in the low temperature hydrothermal fluids and 14 µM in the high temperature hydrothermal fluids. In the low temperature vent fluids, identifiable dissolved organic compounds were dominated by water-soluble vitamins and amino acids. Derivatives of benzoic acid and the organic sulfur compound 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHPS) were also present in low and high temperature hydrothermal fluids. Thus, low temperature vent fluids contain organic compounds that are central to biological processes, suggesting that they are a by-product of subseafloor biological activity. These compounds may fuel heterotrophic, metabolic processes at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and beyond."

Study Protocol Description	"Hydrothermal vent fluids were collected using either the ROV Jason or HOV Alvin deployed from the RV Atlantis during two cruises to the deep-sea hydrothermal vent field at 9º50’N on the East Pacific Rise in January and November 2014 (AT26-10 and AT26-23).
"	"Fluid samples were filtered with 0.2 µM Omnipore filters. The filtrate was acidified and dissolved organic compounds were extracted using Bond Elut PPL cartridges (1 g/6 ml sized cartridges, Agilent) following the previusly published protocol[1] subsequently modified[2].

Eluents were (A) Milli-Q water with 0.1% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The gradient included: hold at 5% B for 2 min; ramp to 65% B for 16 min; ramp to 100% B for 7 min and hold for 8 min. The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min in between analyses with 95% A.

A mixture containing the standards for all of the targeted metabolites was run at 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 ng/ml concentrations."	"Targeted metabolomics data The resulting data were converted to mzML files using the msConvert tool[1] and processed with MAVEN[2]. The measured aqueous concentrations have been corrected for the loss of compounds during the extraction process using determined extraction efficiencies[3]. The concentration of the metabolites are given in picomolar.
