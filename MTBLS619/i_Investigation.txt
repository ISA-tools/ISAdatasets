Study Title	"Response to dietary carbohydrates in European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) muscle tissue as revealed by NMR-based metabolomics"
Study Description	"INTRODUCTION: Feed optimization is a key step to the environmental and economic sustainability of aquaculture, especially for carnivorous species. Plant-derived ingredients can contribute to reduce costs and nitrogenous effluents while sparing wild fish stocks. However, the metabolic use of carbohydrates from vegetable sources by carnivorous fish is still not completely understood. </br> OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the effects of diets with carbohydrates of different digestibilities, gelatinized starch (DS) and raw starch (RS), in the muscle metabolome of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). </br> METHODS: We followed an NMR-metabolomics approach, using two sample preparation procedures, the intact muscle (HRMAS) and the aqueous muscle extracts (1H NMR), to compare the variations in muscle metabolome between the two diets. </br> RESULTS: In muscle, multivariate analysis revealed similar metabolome shifts for DS and RS diets, when compared with the control diet. HRMAS of intact muscle, which included both hydrophobic and hydrophilic metabolites, showed increased lipid in DS-fed fish by univariate analysis. Regardless of the nature of the starch, increased glycine and phenylalanine, and decreased proline were observed when compared to the Ctr diet. Combined univariate analysis of intact muscle and aqueous extracts indicated specific diet related changes in lipid and amino acid metabolism, consistent with increased dietary carbohydrate supplementation. </br> CONCLUSIONS: Due to differential sample processing, outputs differ in detail but provide complementary information. After tracing nutritional alterations by profiling fillet components, DS seems to be the most promising alternative to fishmeal-based diets in aquaculture. This approach should be reproducible for other farmed fish species and provide valuable information on nutritional and organoleptic properties of the final product. </br>"

Study Protocol Description	"Juvenile European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) with an initial mean body weight of 21.9 ± 0.3 g, were randomly assigned to 3 different tanks and reared under the conditions described in detail previously[1]. Briefly, fish were fed with 3 experimental diets (Sparos Lda., Loulé, Portugal): a control carbohydrate-free diet (Ctr), a diet with 30% digestible starch from gelatinized pea meal (DS), and a raw starch diet from crude pea meal (RS) (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). After this period, each group was transferred to a 5% 2H-enriched seawater tank for 6 days to perform hepatic glucose and lipid metabolic studies[1][2]. 24 h after last meal, fish were anesthetized in seawater with MS-222 (0.1 g/l), weighed and sacrificed by cervical section. Muscle fillet samples from the epaxial quadrant were dissected. A biopsy core was punched into each sample, immediately dipped in N2 and stored while the remaining fillet was freeze-clamped in N2. Both samples were stored at − 80 °C until further processing. All experimental procedures complied with the Guidelines of the European Union Council (86/609/EU).

Fish muscle samples were ground in N2, and to each gram of frozen tissue 15.4 ml of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and 4.6 ml of methanol were added. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature under agitation and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 x g. The liquid fraction was separated and extracted with 4 ml of distilled water for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 x g. The aqueous fraction, containing among other FAA, was collected and evaporated to dryness.

For the high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) analysis of muscle biopsies (0.05 ± 0.01 g of intact tissue; Ctr, n=15; DS, n=6; RS, n=7), intact frozen tissues were washed with D2O saline to remove excess blood and packed immediately into 50 μl HRMAS 4 mm zirconia rotors containing 10 μl of D2O saline with 0.25% 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionate sodium salt (TSP)-d4."	"1D proton spectra of aqueous extracts were acquired on a Varian VNMR 600 MHz (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) spectrometer equipped with a 3 mm 1H(X)-PFG inverse configuration probe. All 1H-HRMAS spectra of intact muscle biopsies were acquired on an 800 MHz Bruker Avance II+ (Rheinstetten, Germany) spectrometer using a 4 mm HRMAS probe."	"For extracts, 1H presat pulse sequence was used with the following acquisition parameters: spectral width of 6 kHz, 45° pulse angle, 4 s of acquisition time, 55 s interpulse delay and 16 transients at 298 K. For biopsies, spectra were recorded at 277 K with a spinning rate of 4 kHz, employing the Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) spin-echo pulse sequence with water presaturation and a total spin echo time of 120 ms (n = 444, τ = 270 μs). Typically, 256 transients were acquired with 72k points, spectral width of 12 kHz, relaxation delay of 2 s, and acquisition time of 3 s."	"All spectra were processed using Topspin 3.2 software (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) applying: zero-filling to 64k points, line broadening of 0.3 Hz, phasing and baseline correction. The chemical shifts were referenced internally to the alanine signal at δ 1.48 ppm. Spectral regions between 0.7 and 8.85 ppm (for aqueous extracts) and 0.67 and 5.6 ppm (for biopsies) were used to build data matrices for multivariate analysis, using one-point bucketing (Amix V3.9.15 software, Bruker Biospin, Germany). Water signal region was excluded (4.40–5.25 and 4.75–5.20 ppm for aqueous extracts and biopsies, respectively). Chemical shift variations in recorded spectra were minimized by using icoshift[1] alignment, followed by recursive segment-wise peak alignment[2] where needed, using R statistical package[3]. Probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN)[4] was used to account for different sample sizes and dilutions.
