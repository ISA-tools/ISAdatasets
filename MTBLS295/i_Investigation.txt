Study Identifier	"MTBLS295"
Study Title	"A Phosphate starvation response gene (psr1-like) is present in Micromonas pusilla and other marine algae and coordinates the metabolic response to phosphate deficiency"
Study Description	"Both marine phytoplankton and terrestrial plants have to deal with limited bioavailability of the key life nutrient, phosphate. In freshwater algae and plants, a phosphate starvation response gene (psr1) has been characterized, which encodes for a transcription factor that regulates the metabolic response to phosphate deficiency. This study describes a psr1-like gene present in Micromonas pusilla and other prasinophytes as well as the haptophyte, Emiliana huxleyi. The metabolic response of M. pusilla to P-deficiency, as described from targeted and untargeted metabolomics techniques, was characteristic of an algal response to nutrient limitation with an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids. The levels of many central metabolites, such as amino acids, vitamins, nucleosides, decreased in response to P-deficiency, with a few notable exceptions including malate, aspartate, glutamate, guanine and xanthine. Additionally, genes involved in the metabolic pathways associated with the elevated metabolites share a significant motif in their intron regions, which may be the regulatory element where the psr1 gene product binds. Results form the present study taken together with data from the literature suggests that M. pusilla, other prasionophytes and E. huxleyi, may be physiologically well poised to take advantage of a future ocean with lower nutrient levels and increased levels of pCO2."

Study Protocol Description	"Micromonas pusilla CCMP 1545 was purchased from the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (Boothbay, ME, USA) and grown in 300 ml of L1-Si media (https://ncma.bigelow.org/algal-recipes) using 0.2 µm filtered (Omnipore filters; Millepore, MA, USA) sterilized seawater from Vineyard Sound (MA, USA) as a base.  Cultures were grown for several generations in L1-Si media, following which cultures were grown separately and simultaneously in regular L1-Si media with a 36 µM phosphate (P-replete) and phosphate deficient (P-deficient) L1-Si media with 0.4 µM.  A starter culture in exponential phase of each media type was used to inoculate 18 flasks of media with approximately 10% of the volume (33, 37 ml for P-replete and P-deficient cultures, respectively) totaling 320 ml volume and approximately 300,000 cells.  Another six flasks, three for each media type, contained only the media as cell-free controls.  The cultures were maintained at 22 ºC under a 12:12 light:dark regime (84 µmol/m2/s) and were sampled at approximately 1 hr into the light cycle, at each time point.  Cultures were grown for two weeks and samples were taken on at the time of experimental setup (T0; day 0) and in log phase (T1; day 4 P-deficient; day 6 P-replete) and stationary phase (T2; day 5 P-deficient; day 13 P-replete)."	"The intracellular metabolites were extracted using a method modified from a protocol described by [1]. Briefly, the filter was extracted three times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and dried in a vacufuge.
</p>
The samples for the targeted mass spectrometry analysis were re-dissolved in 90:10 (v/v) water:acetonitrile and combined with deuterated biotin (final concentration 0.05 µg/ml) as an internal standard.
</p>
For untargeted analysis, the extracts had to undergo an additional de-salting step prior to analysis. Therefore, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and extracted using a 50 mg/1 cc PPL cartridge following the protocol of [2]. The resulting methanol extracts were re-dissolved in 95:5 water:acetonitrile.
</p>
The filtrate for each sample, representing the extracellular metabolite fraction, was processed using SPE as described above (following [1]) but with 1 g/6 cc cartridges. The extracellular metabolite extract was redissolved in 500 µl of 95:5 water:acetonitrile for both targeted and untargeted metabolomics analysis.

The chromatography gradient was: an initial hold of 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water) : 5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 2 min, ramp to 65% B from 2 to 20 min, ramp to 100% B from 20 to 25 min, and hold until 32.5 min. The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min between samples with solvent A. Each metabolite was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with optimal parameters determined from infusion of authentic standards. Eight-point external calibration curves (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng/ml) were generated for each compound by plotting peak area against concentration.
</p>
For untargeted metabolomics analysis, LC separation was performed using a Synergi Fusion reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with the same gradient as for targeted analysis."	"For targeted analysis, samples were analyzed with a Thermo Scientific TSQ Vantage Triple Stage Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. This instrument allows polarity switching between positive and negative ion mode within a single LC run. Analysis of authentic standards was used to determine the optimal ionization mode for each metabolite.
</p>
For untargeted analysis, samples were analyzed in both negative and positive ion mode with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled by electrospray ionization to a 7-Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). In parallel to the FT acquisition, four data dependent MS/MS scans were collected at nominal mass resolution in the ion trap (LTQ). Samples were analyzed in random order with a pooled sampled run every six samples in order to assess instrument variability."	"Targeted metabolomics data were analyzed using XCalibur 2.0. The concentration of the metabolites in the targeted mass spectrometry data is given in ng/ml.
</p>
Untargeted metabolomics data were collected as XCalibur RAW files which were converted to mzXML files using the msConvert tool within ProteoWizard [1]. Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS [2], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm [3], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps. CAMERA [4] was used to extract the intensities and m/z values for the associated MS/MS spectra.

Putative identifications were confirmed, where possible, with commercial standards analyzed by our methods (i.e. kynurenine, tryptophan).
</p>
The targeted metabolomics compound identifications were based on measurements of authentic standards on the same mass spectrometer. Note that the LC/mass spectrometry system cannot distinguish between leucine and isoleucine, therefore the data are presented as 'leucine/isoleucine'. Similiarly, threonine and homeserine are not analytically distinct and are presented as 'threonine/homoserine'.
