Study Title	"A synthetic community system for probing microbial interactions driven by exometabolites"
Study Description	"Despite that most microorganisms live as part of community, we have modest knowledge about the interactions among microbial community members in nature, and the implications of those interactions for emergent community properties or ecosystem-relevant functions. To facilitate advances in understanding microbial interactions, we describe a straightforward synthetic community system for interrogating the extracellular interactions among microbial community members. The laboratory-scale system physically separates microbial populations within the community, but allows for chemical interactions via a shared media reservoir. Community goods, including small molecules, extracellular enzymes, and antibiotics, can be assayed using sensitive mass spectrometry, and community member outcomes can be assayed, for example, using flow cytometry, biomass measurements, and transcript analyses. The synthetic community design allows for determining the causes and consequences of community diversity and functional outcomes given manipulation of community membership or structure, abiotic stressors, or temporal dynamics. Because it is versatile to accommodate any artificial or environmental microbiome members, scalable to high-throughput capacity, flexible to an array of experimental designs, and accessible to a variety of laboratories because no specialized or costly components are required, this synthetic community system has the potential to practically advance knowledge of microbial interactions within both natural and artificial communities."

Study Protocol Description	"Freezer stocks of B. thailandensis, C. violaceum, and P. syringae (see Table 1 in the paper associated with this study) were plated on TSA50 at 28 °C for 36 hr. Isolated colonies were inoculated in 5 ml of M9-0.2% glucose media and grown overnight at 28 °C with gentle shaking. Overnight cultures of each strain were diluted 1:20 in fresh M9-glucose media prior to inoculation in the transwell plates (130 µl/well) and the media reservoir was filled with 31 ml M9-glucose. Transwell plates were prepared as described above. For each transwell experiment, a custom R script (“RandomArray”) was used to randomize community member placement in the wells so that each member occupied a total of approximately 31 wells per plate. For each of 4 replicate time courses (where each time course included 5 points assessed every 5 hr over stationary phase), 5 replicate transwell plates were prepared for destructive sampling. Transwell plates were incubated at 28 °C with gentle shaking (~0.32 rcf). The first plate was destructively sampled at 15 h and each subsequent plate was destructively sampled every 5 h thereafter until 35 h. Spent media (~ 31 ml) from the shared reservoir was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C prior to metabolite extraction."	"RPLC-MS:</br>
To prepare samples for non-polar mass spectral analysis, 5-ml aliquots of spent media from each transwell plate media reservoir (5 time points for each of 4 replicate temporal series) and 4 M9-glucose media controls were thawed on ice with 5 ml of 100% methanol. After thawing, solutions were transferred to glass separatory funnels that were initially washed with Liquinox® (Alconox Inc., New York, NY), rinsed with water, dried, and then rinsed 3X with acetone.  3 separate 5-ml liquid-liquid extractions were performed on each sample using dichloromethane, and then the combined volume of the organic layers from each extraction (15 ml) was pooled into a 50 ml canonical tube. The organic layer was dried under nitrogen (N2 Evaporator System, Glas-Col). Samples were re-suspended in 1.0 ml 65%/35% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid in water. 
</p>
HILIC-MS:</br>
To prepare samples for polar mass spectral analysis, 2 ml of the aqueous layer from liquid:liquid extractions was evaporated using a Savant SVC 100H Centrifugal Evaporator. Dried samples were re-suspended in 150 µl of methanol, sonicated (Branson M1800) for 30 min, further re-suspended with the addition of 350 µl of acetonitrile, centrifuged at 20,817 x g for 20 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm PVDF membrane."	"RPLC-MS:</br>
Reverse-phase chromatography and mass detection of exometabolites was performed on a Waters Xevo G2-XS QTof UPLC/MS/MS instrument. For non-polar UPLC analysis, 10 µl was injected into a C18 column (BEH Shield, 2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 μm particle size; Waters,  Milford,  MA)  maintained at 35 °C. Samples were eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min under the following gradient conditions: 99% A:1% B for 1 min, 1%-99% B in 10 min, held at 99% B for 3 min before returning to the initial condition for 1 min. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (pH 2.7), and mobile phase B consisted of acetonitrile.

"Raw Waters MS data files were converted to netCDF file format using MassLynx DataBridge software (Waters, Milford, MA)."	"MS/MS analysis was used for the identification of bactobolin.  Similar UPLC conditions and MS conditions were used as described for polar analysis with the following exceptions: MS set mass: 383.1; MS/MS range acquisition: 40 to 600 m/z; LM resolution: 17.0; and Collision energy ramp: 20-80 eV.
