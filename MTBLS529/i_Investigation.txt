STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS529"
Study Title	"A large-scale metabolomics study to harness chemical diversity and explore biochemical mechanisms in ryegrass (HPLC-MS Hypercarb reverse phase NEG assay)"
Study Description	"Perennial ryegrass (<i>Lolium perenne</i>) is integral to temperate pastoral agriculture, which contributes most of the milk and meat production worldwide. Chemical profiles and diversity of ryegrass offer several opportunities to harness specific traits and elucidate underlying biological mechanisms for forage improvement. We conducted a large-scale metabolomics study of perennial ryegrass comprising 715 genotypes, representing 118 populations from 21 countries. Liquid/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based targeted and non-targeted techniques were used to analyse fructan oligosaccharides, lipids, fatty acid methyl esters, polar and semi-polar compounds. Fructan diversity across all genotypes was evaluated, high- and low-sugar groups identified, and fructan accumulation mechanisms explored. Metabolites differentiating the two groups were characterised, modules and pathways they represent deduced, and finally, visualisation and interpretation provided in a biological context. We also demonstrate a workflow for large-scale metabolomics studies from raw data through to statistical and pathway analysis. <br><br> <b>HPLC-MS Hypercarb reverse phase NEG assay</b> is reported in the current study MTBLS529.<br> <b>UPLC-MS HILIC POS assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS62>MTBLS62</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS HILIC NEG assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS63>MTBLS63</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS C18 reverse phase POS assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS64>MTBLS64</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS C18 reverse phase NEG assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS65>MTBLS65</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS C1 reverse phase POS and GC-MS FAME assays</b> are reported in <a href=""https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS66"">MTBLS66</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS C1 reverse phase NEG assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS68>MTBLS68</a>.<br>"

Study Protocol Description	"Ryegrass seeds were obtained from the Margot Forde Germplasm Centre at AgResearch Limited, Grasslands Research Centre, Palmerston North, New Zealand. Seeds of 724 genotypes (denoted by a specific code e.g. PG0698) which included NZ cultivars (82), natural population/ecotypes (49), NZ elite breeding populations (336), overseas cultivars (181), enhanced germplasm (71) and unknown cultivars (5) were selected. 5 clonal replicates (n = 5; denoted as PG0698_1 for the first replicate) per genotype were cultivated and used for metabolomics studies."	"At 60 days after transplanting, leaves were harvested during late autumn (May 2012), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze-dried, ground to a coarse powder, transferred to glass vials&nbsp;&nbsp; and stored at -80 °C until further use. 5 aliquots of 50 mg each (4 for analyses and 1 standby) of each sample were weighed into microcentrifuge tubes. A surrogate QC sample comprising random amounts of ground ryegrass leaf material, irrespective of the presence or absence of endophyte was used. Since this QC sample was not representative of the sample set, it was solely used for monitoring sample degradation and for tracking run-order effects within a batch, and not used for batch normalisations or ensuing data processing.<br><br>Boiling water (1.5 ml) was added to another aliquot (50 mg). After homogenisation, samples were placed in a hot water bath (90 °C) for 30 min. Samples were cooled to room temperature, centrifuged, and approximately 500 µl of the aqueous extract was transferred to an autosampler vial for analysis. Samples were stored (-20 °C) for a minimal period to avoid fructan degradation."	"Fructans were analysed as described previously[1]. Briefly, filtrates (20 μl) were injected using an HTS PAL autosampler with a 25-μl syringe and a 15,000-psi injection valve (CTC Analytics., Zwingen, Switzerland). 2 High Pressure Gradient JASCO X-LC 3085PU HPLC pumps (JASCO International, Tokyo, Japan) were used, pumping MilliQ water (solvent A) and LiChroSolv (HPLC-grade) acetonitrile (Merck, Palmerston North, New Zealand) (solvent B). Oligosaccharides were separated on a Thermo Hypercarb column (100 x 2.1 mm, 5 μm particle size, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), running the following program at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min: initial 1% B hold for 0.5 min, to 10% B after 1 min, to 16% B at 6 min, to 20% B at 12 min, to 30% B at 16 min, to 90% B at 18 min, hold to 20 min, and back to initial condition for 5-min equilibration.<br><br>For each stream of analysis, samples (3575) were systematically randomised across 36 batches, making sure that 2 clonal replicates of a genotype were not present in the same batch. A single batch comprised approximately 100 samples interspersed with a QC sample for every 10 samples (10-12 QC samples per batch). The sequence comprised blanks, QC and samples.<br><br>Ref:<br>[1] Harrison SJ, Fraser K, Lane GA, Villas-Boas S, Rasmussen S.
