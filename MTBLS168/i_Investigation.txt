Study Title	"The metabolic background is a global player in Saccharomyces gene expression epistasis"
Study Description	"The regulation of gene expression in response to nutrient availability is fundamental to the genotype-phenotype relationship. The metabolic-genetic make-up of the cell, as reflected in auxotrophy, is hence likely to be a determinant of gene expression. Here, we address the importance of the metabolic-genetic background by monitoring transcriptome, proteome and metabolome in a repertoire of 16 Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory backgrounds, combinatorially perturbed in histidine, leucine, methionine and uracil biosynthesis. The metabolic background affected up to 85% of the coding genome. Suggesting widespread confounding, these transcriptional changes show, on average, 83% overlap between unrelated auxotrophs and 35% with previously published transcriptomes generated for non-metabolic gene knockouts. Background-dependent gene expression correlated with metabolic flux and acted, predominantly through masking or suppression, on 88% of transcriptional interactions epistatically. As a consequence, the deletion of the same metabolic gene in a different background could provoke an entirely different transcriptional response. Propagating to the proteome and scaling up at the metabolome, metabolic background dependencies reveal the prevalence of metabolism-dependent epistasis at all regulatory levels. Urging a fundamental change of the prevailing laboratory practice of using auxotrophs and nutrient supplemented media, these results reveal epistatic intertwining of metabolism with gene expression on the genomic scale."

Study Protocol Description	"Pre-cultures of the S. cerevisiae strains were prepared in drop-in media (synthetic minimal media supplemented only with the nutrients to complement auxotrophic requirements) and cultured for 12-20 h in a 96-well plate (30 °C, 250 rpm). Main-cultures were inoculated in fresh synthetic completed media and cultivation, sample collection, quenching and metabolite extraction were performed according to [1]. Specifically, the yeast strains were cultured in 96-well fritted plates (1 strain per two wells) (Nunc, USA) with a 4 mm glass bead in each well for mixing. For quenching a 48-well plate containing 3.6 ml -40°C quenching solution  (60% methanol, 10 mM NH4-acetate) per well was prepared and put into a vacuum manifold. Mid-exponential cultures were put on top of the 48-well plate and sucked into the quenching solution. The quenched cultures were centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm -9 °C and the supernatant was discarded. Subsequently, the plate with the cell pellets was transferred into a -50 °C ethanol bath with dry ice.

Specifically, the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml precooled extraction solution (75% ethanol, 10 mM NH4-acetate) and 50 µl 13C-yeast internal standard was added. To complete extraction, the plate was transferred into a 80 °C water bath for 3 min with vortexing steps every 30-45 s. The extracts were stored at -80 °C until they were dried over night with a vacuum centrifuge (Christ-RVC 2-33 CD plus, Kuehner AG, Switzerland).
