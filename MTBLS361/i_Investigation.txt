Study Title	"Kidney Tissue Targeted Metabolic Profiling of Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction Rats by NMR."
Study Description	"Renal interstitial fibrosis is a common pathological process in the progression of kidney disease. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics approach was used to analyze the kidney tissues of renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) rats, induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). The combination of a variety of statistical methods was used to screen out 14 significantly changed potential metabolites related with multiple biochemical processes including amino acid metabolism, adenine metabolism, energy metabolism, osmolyte change and induced oxidative stress. The exploration of the contralateral kidneys enhanced the understanding of the disease, which was also supported by serum biochemistry and kidney histopathology results. In addition, the pathological parameters (clinical chemistry, histological and immunohistochemistry results) were correlated with the significantly changed differential metabolites related with RIF. This study shows that target tissue metabolomics analysis can be used as a useful tool to understand the mechanism of the disease and provide a novel insight in the pathogenesis of RIF."

Study Protocol Description	"Blood samples were acquired via the arteria cruralis into EP tubes and centrifuged (3,500 rpm, 15 min) to obtain serum. Kidney tissue was excised and weighed. One half of the left (A) and the right (B) kidney of UUO and SO (C and D) groups respectively were rinsed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C."	"Kidney tissues were weighted and extracted in a 2:1 ratio of methanol and water by use of an Ultrasonic cell crusher (Ningbo Scientz biotechnology Co., LTD, China)."	"The supernatants were freeze-dried and reconstituted into 700 μl phosphate buffer (0.1 M, KH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.01% TSP and 10% D2O. Following centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min), 600 μl of each supernatant was transferred into a 5 mm NMR tube for NMR analysis."	"1H NMR spectra was acquired on a Bruker 600-MHz AVANCE III NMR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Germany) at 298 K."	"Typically, 64 scans were collected into 65,536 data points over a spectral width of 12,345.7 Hz with a relaxation delay of 1.0 s and an acquisition time of 2.65 s."	"All spectra were carefully phased and baseline corrected and referenced to TSP δ 0.00 using MestReNova (version 8.0.1, Mestrelab Research, Santiago de Compostella, Spain) software. Region distorted by residual water (δ 4.68-5.23) was excluded in the subsequent analysis. Then, all spectra were segmented at 0.01 ppm (buckets) across δ 0.78-9.66 and normalized to tissue weights, and the normalized integral values were then subjected to multivariate data analysis using Simca-P 13.0 software (Umetrics, Sweden)."	"Resonance assignments were performed on the basis of the chemical shifts of standard compounds from the Chenomx NMR suite (evaluation version, Chenomx Inc., Canada), the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB, http://www.hmdb.ca/spectra/nmr_one_d/search)[1], and Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB, http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu)[2], as well as the literature data[3][4]. In addition, 2D HSQC and COSY were also used to confirm the assignment (see Figures S2 and S3 respectively in the paper associated with this study). The cross-peaks in HSQC were manually picked, and 370 peaks in [1H, 13C] format were input in COLMAR 13C-1H Query server (http://spin.ccic.ohio-state.edu/index.php/hsqc/)[5]. The cutoff value for 1H and 13C were set as 0.06 and 0.6 ppm, respectively. The results were manually checked by interactive user interface using the “Show Me” button, as well as the parameter of Matching ratio and Uniqueness.
