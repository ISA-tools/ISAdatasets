Study Title	"massPix: An R package for annotation and interpretation of mass spectrometry imaging data for lipidomics"
Study Description	"Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) experiments result in complex multi-dimensional datasets, which require specialist data analysis tools. Here we have developed massPix - an R package for analysing and interpreting data from MSI of lipids in tissue. MassPix is an open-source tool for the analysis and statistical interpretation of MSI data, and is particularly useful for lipidomics applications. MassPix produces single ion images, performs multivariate statistics and provides putative lipid annotations based on accurate mass matching against generated lipid libraries. Classification of tissue regions with high spectral similarly can be carried out by principal components analysis (PCA) or k-means clustering. Mouse cerebellum was analysed using matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) MSI. The resulting MSI dataset forms the test data for massPix."

Study Protocol Description	"Brain tissue was dissected from euthanised mouse using approved procedures at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom. All applicable international, national, and institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed."	"The excised tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded in OCT and stored in a freezer at -80 °C, prior to cryosectioning at -20 °C to 15 micrometers thickness. Sections were thaw mounted onto SuperFrost® Glass slides (76 x 25 mm, VWR). No staining was performed. Sections were stored at -80 °C until analysis. A section corresponding to the cerebellum region was thawed in a vacuum desiccator, and coated with 40 layers of 2’,4’,6’-trihydroxyacetophenone monohydrate matrix (Sigma Aldrich, 10 mg/mL in 85:15 v/v methanol : water) using a SunCollect sprayer (SunChrom)."	"MALDI imaging was performed in positive ion mode over an m/z range of 300 – 2000 using a Thermo MALDI LTQ Orbitrap XL instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The spatial resolution was 50 micrometers. "	"Not applicable."	"Raw data, in profile mode, was converted to mzML format using ProteoWizard (http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net), and then to imzML format using imzMLConverter [1,2]. The resulting imzML and ibd files were used as test data for in-house R package “massPix v1.2”.
