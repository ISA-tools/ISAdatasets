Study Title	"Deletion of glycerol channel aquaporin-9 (Aqp9) impairs long-term blood glucose control in C57BL/6 leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) obese mice."
Study Description	"Deletion of the glycerol channel aquaporin-9 (Aqp9) reduces postprandial blood glucose levels in leptin receptor deficient (db/db) obese mice on a C57BL/6×C57BLKS mixed genetic background. Furthermore, shRNA mediated reduction of Aqp9 expression reduces liver triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in a diet induced rat model of obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate metabolic effects of Aqp9 deletion in coisogenic db/db mice of the C57BL/6 background. Aqp9wt db/db and Aqp9-/- db/db mice did not differ in body weight and liver TAG contents. On the C57BL/6 genetic background we observed elevated plasma glucose in Aqp9-/- db/db mice (+ 1.1 mM, life-time average) while plasma insulin concentration was reduced at time of death. Glucose levels changed similarly in pentobarbital anesthetized, glucagon challenged Aqp9wt db/db and Aqp9-/- db/db mice. Liver transcriptional profiling did not detect differential gene expression between genotypes. Metabolite profiling revealed a sex independent increase in plasma glycerol (+55%), glucose (+24%) and reduction in threonate (all at q<0.1) in Aqp9-/- db/db mice compared to controls. Metabolite profiling thus confirms a role of AQP9 in glycerol metabolism of obese C57BL/6 db/db mice. In this animal model of obesity Aqp9 gene deletion elevates plasma glucose and does not alleviate hepatosteatosis."

Study Protocol Description	"Liver Samples:</br>
db/db mice were starved from 9:00-13:00 h and lean mice were starved from 16:45-09:00 h. Mice were anesthetized (Hypnorm/Dormicum or Fentanyl/Medetomidine/Midazolam (0.05/5/1 mg/kg IP) – as indicated in sample sheets) exsanguinated by cardiac puncture or decapitation. Blood was collected in Heparinized tubes (Sarstedt Microvette 500) and ~50 mg pieces of tissue were collected in 2 ml Axygen tubes + 1 ml MetOH:H2O 1:1 (exactly 22.824 g H2O + 19.186 g MetOH). Tissue was weighed and adjusted to 50 mg/ml concentration with extra Methanol:H2O. The samples were homogenized with Omni THQ hard tissue plastic tips at 11.000 rpm; freezed in Liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C until further use.
</p>
Plasma Samples:</br>
Plasma was prepared from blood by spinning for 2 min at 4300 x g, transferring plasma to a 1.5 ml Sarstedt tube and snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further use.</br>"	"Liver Samples:</br>
Samples were thawed on an ice water slurry. Standard 1 ml colorless Sarstedt tips and 1 ml pipette were used for all pipetting. They were re-suspended and 1 ml to 500 µl pre-chilled (on dry-ice) 1:1 MethOH:H2O was added. They were put back to the ice-water bath and mixed. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. One blank sample was also put through the whole procedure on 12/18/2013.
</p>
The supernatant was collected and transfered to a 2 ml Axygen Eppendorf tube. The pellet in the tube was retained on ice for organic extraction. Two 250 µl aliquots were taken for LC-MS analyses into 1.5 ml Eppendorf Safe-lock tubes (plus 50 µl for GC-MS analysis). For QC analysis, 150 µl of each sample was taken. Samples 248, 250, 266, 267, 268, 269, 275, 276, 277, 279, 294 were used with colorless standard 200 µl tips. Then two 250 µl samples of the combined pool was transferred into Eppendorf safelock tubes and dried along with the other tubes. The aqueous extracts were dried in a Speedvac concentrator at 45 °C for 3 hours (only 2 hrs from 06172014, and only 1 hr for 50 µl samples). The prepared sample was stored at -80 °C (GC-MS samples were initially stored at -20 °C and later at -80 °C before analysis).  The dried samples were extracted into liquid (water/methanol 20/80 v/v), shaken for 3 min at 30 Hz, and centrifuged for 10 min at 17350 x g and 4 °C.
</p>
Plasma Samples:</br>
Metabolites were extracted from 15 µl plasma using a one-phase liquid extraction protocol, as previously described in detail [1]. Extracts were dried using vacuum centrifugation (MiVac…), and derivatized by methoximation and trimethylsilylation.
