Study Title	"Flow cytometry has a significant impact on the cellular metabolome (GC-MS assay)"
Study Description	"The characterization of specialized cell subpopulations in a heterogeneous tissue is essential for understanding organ function in health and disease. A popular method of cell isolation is fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on probes that bind surface or intracellular markers. In this study, we analyse the impact of FACS on the cell metabolome of mouse peritoneal macrophages. Compared with directly pelleted macrophages, FACS-treated cells had an altered content of metabolites related to the plasma membrane, activating a mechanosensory signalling cascade causing inflammation-like stress. The procedure also triggered alterations related to energy consumption and cell damage. The observed changes mostly derive from the physical impact on cells during their passage through the instrument. These findings provide evidence of FACS-induced biochemical changes, which should be taken into account in the design of robust metabolic assays of cells separated by flow cytometry. </br></br> The GC-MS assay is reported in the current study MTBLS634. </br> The General LC-MS assay is reported in MTBLS629. </br> The Lipidomic LC-MS assay is reported in MTBLS631. </br></br> The CE-MS assay is reported in MTBLS633. </br></br> Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS629' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS629</span></a> <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS631' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS631</span></a> <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS633' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS633</span></a>"

Study Protocol Description	"Thioglycollate solution (3%) was injected into the peritoneal cavity of 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice to elicit the accumulation of macrophages. Animals were sacrificed 72 h after the injection, and the accumulated macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage with 10 m sterile PBS. After centrifugation (1400 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) and washing in 5 ml PBS (1400 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), cells were counted under the microscope, divided into 4 equal volumes, and centrifuged (1400 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C). After counting and washing the cell pellet in the Ctrl sample was immediately snap-frozen in liq. N2. For the Ab sample, the cell pellet was resuspended in blocking buffer containing anti-CD16/CD32 (Mouse Fc Block, #553141, BD Bioscience - Pharmingen), incubated on ice for 20 min, and subsequently washed in PBS. The cells were then incubated on ice for 20 min with PerCP-Cy5.5-labeled anti-CD45 (#550994, BD Bioscience - Pharmingen) and washed in PBS. After the final washing step, the cell pellet was immediately frozen in liq. N2. The sorted unlabelled cell sample (Sort) and the sorted immunostained cell sample (Ab+Sort) were prepared following the protocols for the Ctrl and Ab groups, respectively, but instead of snap freezing, the cell pellets were resuspended in PBS for FACS. The complete cell populations were sorted in a BD FACSAria II flow cytometer and the data analysed with FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC) (see Figure S6 in the paper associated with this study). No sub-populations were isolated in order to ensure that sample composition remained comparable to the Ctrl and Ab groups and to identify biochemical changes induced solely by the sorting process. After collection, cells from the Sort and Ab+Sort group were pelleted, frozen in liq. N2, and stored at -80 °C until fingerprinting analysis."	"Since biological replicates differed slightly in cell number, the extraction solvent volume was calculated according to the cell pellet mass, thus ensuring between-sample normalization of metabolite concentrations (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). On the day of analysis, cell pellets were thawed and doubly extracted by sequential additions of i) MeOH:MTBE (4:1, v/v) and ii) MeOH:H2O (4:1, v/v). Each solvent addition was followed by 3 cycles of freeze/thawing (liq. N2 /cold-water bath, 10 s), sonication (15 W, 6 min), vortexing (1 min), and centrifugation (16,000 x g, 10 min, 4 °C). Equal volumes of the supernatants from i and ii were then mixed and aliquoted for subsequent analysis.
</p>
For GC-MS, 100 µl of the the supernatant mix were evaporated to dryness in a Speedvac Concentrator and the sample was reconstituted in 10 µl O-methoxyamine hydrochloride (15 mg/ml) in pyridine for methoximation. After gentle vortexing, the vials were incubated in darkness at room temperature for 16 h. Next, 10 µl BSTFA containing 1% TMCS (v/v) were added, and samples were vortexed for 5 min; silylation was carried out for 1 h at 70 °C, and finally 100 µl of C18:0 methyl ester (10 mg/l in heptane) were added as an internal standard and samples were remixed by gentle vortexing. 6 blank samples were prepared by the same extraction and derivatization procedure.
</p>
QC samples are required at the beginning of the sequence to stabilize the system and throughout the analytical runs at periodic intervals to monitor variations in signals over time. Individual QC samples were therefore prepared independently for each analytical platform by pooling and mixing equal volumes of each sample. After gentle vortexing, the mixes were transferred to analytical vials."	"For GC-MS, the GC system (Agilent Technologies 7890A) consisted of an autosampler (Agilent Technologies 7693) and an inert MSD quadrupole detector (Agilent Technologies 5975). The derivatized sample (2 µl) was injected through a DB5-MS GC-Column (length, 30 m; internal diameter, 0.25 mm; film, 0.25 μm 95% dimethylpolysiloxane/5% diphenylpolysiloxane) with a pre-column (10 m J&W integrated with an Agilent 122-5532G column). The flow rate of the helium carrier gas was set at 1 ml/min and the injector temperature was 250 °C. The split ratio was 1:10 flow into a Restek 20782 deactivated glass-wool split liner. The temperature gradient was programmed at 60 °C (held for 1 min), with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min up to 325 °C. The column was cooled for 10 min between injections. The total analysis time was 37.5 min. The detector transfer line, filament source, and quadrupole temperature were respectively set at 290 °C, 230 °C, and 150 °C."	"For GC-MS, data were collected on a mass spectrometer detector Agilent Technologies 5975). The electron ionization (EI) source was set at 70 eV. The mass spectrometer was operated in scan mode over a mass range of m/z 50-600 at a rate of 2 spectra/s. The method was retention-time locked at 19.663 minutes (elution time of the internal standard). The analytical run was set up to start with the injection of C18:0 methyl ester (10 mg/l in heptane) and FAME mix (0.1 mg/ml in CH2Cl2) followed by 3 blanks and 5 QCs and then samples in a randomized order, with other QCs were injected between blocks of 4 unblinded samples until the end of the run, which terminated with the re-injection of the 3 blanks."	"In GC-MS, deconvolution and identification were performed using MassHunter Quantitative Unknowns Analysis (B.07.00, Agilent), data were aligned with MassProfiler Professional (version 13.0, Agilent) and peaks were integrated using MassHunter Quantitative Analysis software (version B.07.00, Agilent). In order to perform the differential analysis on the metabolomics data, in all the platforms the raw variables were then filtered according to a modification of the filtering criteria previously proposed[1]: variables present in at least 50% of the samples of each experimental group and either i) present in at least 80% of the QCs that yielded a variation coefficient <30% or ii) present in <20% of the QCs. Principal component analysis (PCA) models (see Figure 2 in the paper associated with this study) were subsequently built using the SIMCA-P+ software (12.0.1.0, Umetrics). Next, after replacement of missing values by k-means nearest neighbour analysis according to the ccriteria previously published[2], the Mann-Whitney U test was used for all comparisons (i.e., Ctrl vs Ab; Ctrl vs Sort; and Ctrl vs Ab+Sort) followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg post hoc correction (p < 0.05). Missing values were imputed and statistical comparisons made using in-house built scripts for MATLAB (7.10.0.499, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).

The biological role of identified compounds was evaluated and irrelevant identifications such as pesticides, drugs, or impossible chemical structures were excluded. In the final list (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study), metabolites are reported according to the criteria of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative[2][3], with a confidence level in grade 1 (identified metabolites). Variation between experimental conditions is reported as log2 FC, always relative to control. The number of hits per analytical platform that passed each step is listed in Table 1 in the paper associated with this study.
