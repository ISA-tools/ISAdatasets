Study Title	Antibiotics create a shift from mutualism to competition in human gut communities with a longer-lasting impact on fungi than bacteria																	
Study Description	"<p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Antibiotic treatment has a well-established detrimental effect on the gut bacterial composition, but effects on the fungal community are less clear. Bacteria in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract may limit fungal colonization and invasion. Antibiotic drugs targeting bacteria are therefore seen as an important risk factor for fungal infections and induced allergies. However, antibiotic effects on gut bacterial-fungal interactions, including disruption and resilience of fungal community compositions, were not investigated in humans. We analysed stool samples collected from 14 healthy human participants over three months following a 6-day antibiotic administration. We integrated data from shotgun metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and fungal ITS2 sequencing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>While the bacterial community recovered mostly over three months post treatment, the fungal community was shifted from mutualism at baseline to competition. Half of the bacterial-fungal interactions present before drug intervention had disappeared three months later. During treatment, fungal abundances were associated with the expression of bacterial genes with functions for cell growth and repair. By extending the metagenomic species approach, we revealed bacterial strains inhibiting the opportunistic fungal pathogen&nbsp;Candida albicans. We demonstrate&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;how&nbsp;C. albicans pathogenicity and host cell damage might be controlled naturally in the human gut by bacterial metabolites such as propionate or 5-dodecenoate.</p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p><p>We demonstrate that antibacterial drugs have long-term influence on the human gut mycobiome. While bacterial communities recovered mostly 30-days post antibacterial treatment, the fungal community was shifted from mutualism towards competition.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Linked data:</strong></p><p>Metagenomics has been submitted to NCBI SRA repository as projects PRJNA573821, PRJNA573905 and PRJNA579284.</p>"

Study Protocol Description	"<p>Stool samples were from healthy adults, aged 18-65 years, from Hong Kong. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 17-042). All work was performed in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice principles and the Helsinki declaration. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. </p><p>Participant characteristics are described in (Suppl. Table 12 of associated manuscript). Subjects with any of the exclusion criteria below were not eligible for entry into the present study: (i) History of taking antibiotics over the last 6 months; (ii) receiving systemic antifungals/ antifungal mouthwashes or probiotics concurrently; (iii) patients suffering from immunosuppressive conditions or taking immunosuppressants; (iv) severe medical comorbidities requiring frequent hospitalization.</p><p><br></p><p>Participants were treated for 6 days with 1 antibiotic drug out of 5: Doxycycline (tetracycline class), Azithromycin (macrolide class), Augmentin (β-lactam class), Ciprofloxacin (quinolone class), Cefuroxime (β-lactam class) or untreated used as controls.</p><p><br></p><p>From each participant in the clinical study, four stool samples were obtained at 7 days before treatment (± 1 day), day 6 of treatment, and 30 and 90 days after treatment. Collected samples were&nbsp;aliquoted and stored at -80 °C immediately after collection until metabolomic experiments.</p><p><br></p>"	"<p>A total of 15 samples were submitted to the Metabo-Profile R&amp;D laboratory and immediately stored at -80 °C freezer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Nashville, NC, USA) until analysis. The total number of samples that have been processed and analyzed by Metabo-Profile was 15.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>LCMS</u></strong></p><p>For bile acid profiles, bile acid-free matrix (BAFM) was obtained using the charcoal-stripping protocol. Calibrators and quality controls were prepared for the BAFM and processed as for extraction of bile acids from stool samples. About 10 mg prechilled zirconium oxide beads was added to 10 mg stool with 15 μl ultrapure water. To each sample, a 200 μl aliquot of prechilled acetonitrile/methanol containing 10 internal standards was added for homogenization. After centrifugation at 13,500 rpm and 4 °C for 20 min, 50 μl supernatant was transferred to 96-well plates. Acetonitrile/water (150 μl) was added for gentle shaking for 5 min before injection into an ultra-performance liquid chromatography column coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) system to quantitate bile acids.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>GCMS</u></strong></p><p>MicrobioMET profiles including aromatic phenols and indoles, phenolic acids, short-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids, amino acids and organic acids were quantitated using gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC-TOFMS). Samples were thawed on ice-bath to diminish sample degradation. Stool aliquots (50 mg) were homogenized with 300 μl NaOH (1M) solution using a homogenizer and centrifuged at 13,500 rpm and 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatants (200 μl) were transferred into autosampler vials and residue extracted with 200 μl cold methanol. After a second homogenization and centrifugation, 167 μl supernatant was combined with the first supernatant in the autosampler vial. </p><p>Extracts were capped and used for automated sample derivatization by a robotic multipurpose sample MPS2 with dual heads (Gerstel, Muehlheim, Germany). Briefly, each 20 μl of MCF was added to the mixture and the sample was vortexed vigorously for exact 30 s. Another 20 μl of MCF was added for the second time derivatization. Four hundred microliter of chloroform followed by four hundred microliter of sodium bicarbonate solution was added to achieve the separation. The prepared samples were centrifuged at 4°C and 4000g for 20 min, and the bottom chloroform layer was carefully transferred by the robotic preparation station to capped empty autosampler viral preloaded with approximately 25 mg of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The sample pre-treated with sodium sulfate was shaken on a laboratory shaker at 1500 rpm and 4°C for 20 min and further transferred to a capped empty autosampler viral for injection (GC-TOFMS).</p><p><br></p><p><em><u>Internal standards</u></em></p><p>dehydroLCA; LCA; isoDCA; isoLCA; alloLCA; GLCA; DCA; CDCA; TLCA; apaCA; NorDCA; 12-ketoLCA; 7-ketoLCA; 6,7-diketoLCA; GDCA; 6-ketoLCA; GCDCA; HDCA; UDCA; CA; TDCA; ACA; βHDCA; 3-DHCA; TCDCA; βUDCA; muroCA; HCA; 12-DHCA; βMCA; NorCA; 7-ketoDCA; GCA;&nbsp;&nbsp;αMCA; GHDCA; βCA; GUDCA; ωMCA; TCA; GHCA; THDCA; TUDCA; 7,12-diketoLCA; DHCA; UCA; THCA; TβMCA; TαMCA; GDHCA;T ωMCA; TDHCA</p>"	"<p><strong><u>LCMS</u></strong></p><p>The ACQUITY UPLC-Xevo TQ-S (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) with ACQUITY UPLC Cortecs C18 1.6μM VanGuard pre-column and ACQUITY UPLC Cortecs C18 1.6μM analytical column was used to quantitate bile acids in this project.

For most analyses a plot of instrument response vs. concentration will show a linear relationship. This yields a model described by the equation y = ax + b, where y is the instrument response e.g., peak height or area, a represents the slope / sensitivity, and b is a constant that describes the background. The analyte concentration (x) of unknown samples may be calculated from this equation.</p>"
