Study Title	"A female gametocyte-specific ABC transporter plays a role in lipid metabolism in the malaria parasite"
Study Description	"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters serve a variety of physiological functions as well as play key roles in drug resistance. The genome of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, encodes multiple members of this family, one of which, gABCG2, is transcribed predominantly in the gametocyte stage. Here we use gene deletion and tagging to investigate the expression, localization and function of gABCG2. The protein is found in a single dot-like lipid-rich structure within female, but not male, gametocytes. gABCG2-knockout cell lines produce more gametocytes of both sexes. By contrast, cholesteryl esters, diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols are significantly reduced in gABCG2-knockout gametocyte stages. We propose a role for gABCG2 in the regulation of gametocyte numbers and in the accumulation of neutral lipids, which are likely important for parasite development in the insect stages of the parasite life cycle."

Study Protocol Description	"Each analysis was performed on three independent biological samples. Synchronous infected red blood cells were enriched using magnetic cell sorting columns (CS and D columns; MACS Cell Separation, Miltenyi Biotec), washed in PBS and then counted on a haemocytometer."	"Lipid extraction was performed using a modification of the method of Matyash et al. In brief, 10^7 of magnet-purified cells were added to 2 ml tough tubes (Geneworks, Hindmarsh, SA, Australia) on dry ice, fixed with 300 µl of methanol and stored at -80°C until extraction step. An aliquot of 100 µl of methanol containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene and internal standards was added to each tube. Samples were homogenised using a bead homogeniser (FastPrep-24, MP Biomedical, Seven Hills, NSW, Australia) at 6 m/s for 40 seconds and the homogenate removed to 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, North Ryde, NSW, Australia). Beads were washed with 100 µl of methanol and the wash added to the homogenate. A 1 ml aliquot of methyl-tert butyl ether was added and samples were vortexed at 4oC for 1 hour. An addition of 300 µl of 150 mM ammonium acetate (LC-MS grade, Fluka, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) was added to induce phase separation. Tubes were vortexed for 15 minutes and centrifuged at 2000Xg for 5 minutes to complete phase separation. Approximately 800 µl of the upper organic layer was removed to a new 2 ml glass vial and stored at -20 °C until analysis. Extracts were diluted 40-fold into methanol:chloroform (2:1 v/v) containing 5 mM ammonium acetate prior to mass spectrometric analysis."	"Samples were introduced using using a Triversa Nanomate (Advion, Ithaca US)."	"Mass spectra were acquired using a chip based nano-electrospray ionization source (TriVersa Nanomate®, Advion, Ithaca, NY, USA) coupled to a hybrid linear ion trap-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QTRAP® 5500, ABSCIEX, Foster City, CA, USA). A 10 µl aliquot of methanol:chloroform diluted extract was aspirated from a sealed 96-well plate (Eppendorf Twin-Tec) and delivered into the mass spectrometer via a nano-electrospray ionization (ESI) chip with an orifice diameter of 4.1 µm. The delivery gas was N2 at a pressure of 0.4 psi and a spray voltage of 1.15 kV was used for positive ion acquisition. Experimental conditions for positive ion mode acquisition were a declustering potential of 100 V, entrance potential of 10 V and a scan rate of 200 m/z units.s-1. Mass spectra were averaged over 50 scans. "	"Data were analyzed with LipidView® (ABSCIEX) software version 1.2, including smoothing, identification, removal of isotope contribution from lower mass species, and correction for isotope distribution."	"Ionized lipids detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) over 20 were included in the analysis. Extraction and solvent blanks were included in the analysis to allow exclusion of ions detected at lipid masses that result from extraction chemical or solvent impurities. Quantification was achieved in LipidView® software by comparison of the peak area of individual lipids to their class-specific internal standards after isotope correction. Ions detected at masses that could be assigned to odd-chain fatty acid, phospholipids or ether-linked phospholipids were assumed to be ether-linked. Ether-linked PE species produce the 141 head group fragment at approximately 29% the efficiency of di-acyl PE species; therefore a correction factor of 3.45 was applied to all ether-PE species 67. Sphingomyelin species were detected using the 184.1 m/z precursor ion scan, which cannot distinguish between isobaric DHSM and SM species. Ions detected at masses that could be assigned to DHSM or SM were assumed to contain the major SM backbone d18:1, and are listed as species indicating the respective N-linked fatty acid. "
