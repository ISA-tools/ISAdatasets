Study Title	"Metabolomic profiling of Fraxinus excelsior genotypes tolerant or susceptible to ash dieback disease reveals changes in iridoid glycosides"
Study Description	"European common ash, Fraxinus excelsior L., is currently threatened by Ash dieback (ADB) caused by the fungus, Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. To detect and identify metabolites that may be products of pathways important in contributing to resistance against H. fraxineus we performed untargeted metabolomic profiling on leaves from selected F. excelsior individuals showing strong tolerance or susceptibility to H. fraxineus. We identified sets of “features” [small molecules] that enabled strong discrimination between tolerant or susceptible genotypes of F. excelsior. Strikingly, tolerant F. excelsior lines exhibited low levels of iridoid glycosides, known anti-feeding deterrents. As Europe is threatened by Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis), an invasive wood boring beetle native to East Asia that has devastated North American ash, our study raises the question whether selection for resistance to H. fraxineus leads to ecological trade-offs that result in susceptibility to emerging pests such as emerald ash borer."

Study Protocol Description	"Scions were collected from the 15 trees in either Randers or Tapsøre during January and February 2013, grafted onto rootstocks of F. excelsior seedlings, potted and placed in a greenhouse at the University of Copenhagen. Leaves were sampled in two batches: #-Taps trees (except 25Utaps) were sampled in May 2014 while R- trees (plus 25UTaps) were sampled in September 2014. All plants were symptom free at the time of sampling. Three leaves were sampled from each graft, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C."	"Three leaflets from each triplicate sample were freeze dried and gently crushed. Approximately 100 mg was ground to a fine powder using a TissueLyser (Qiagen), and 10 mg was extracted in 400 ul 80% MeOH containing d5-IAA internal standard at 2.5 ng/ml, centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min) and the pellet re-extracted in 80% MeOH. The pooled supernatants were filtered through a 0.2 µm syringe filter (Phenomenex, UK)."	"These leaf extracts (5 µl) were analysed using a Polaris C18 1.8 µm, 2.1 x 250 mm reverse phase analytical column (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) and samples resolved on an Agilent 1200 series Rapid Resolution HPLC system coupled to a QToF 6520 mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA). Buffers were as follows: positive ion mode; mobile phase A (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), mobile phase B (95% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid). Negative ion mode; mobile phase A (5% acetonitrile with 1 mM ammonium fluoride), mobile phase B (95% acetonitrile). The following gradient was used: 0-10 min – 0% B; 10-30 min – 0-100% B; 30-40 min – 100% B. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min and the column temperature was held at 35 °C throughout."	"Data were collected on a quadrapole time of flight QToF 6520 mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA). The source conditions for electrospray ionisation were as follows: gas temperature was 325 °C with a drying gas flow rate of 9 l/min and a nebuliser pressure of 35 psig. The capillary voltage was 3.5 kV in both positive and negative ion mode. The fragmentor voltage was 115 V and skimmer 70 V. Scanning was performed using the autoMS/MS function at 4 scans/s for precursor ion surveying and 3 scans/s for MS/MS with a sloped collision energy of 3.5 V/100 Da with an offset of 5 V."	"Positive and negative ion data was converted into mzData using the export option in Agilent MassHunter. Peak identification and alignment was performed using the Bioconductor R package, xcms [1]. Using xcms, features were detected using the centWave method for high resolution LC/MS data in centroid mode at 30 ppm. Changes to the default parameters were: mzdiff=0.01, peakwidth=10-80, noise=1000, prefilter=3,500.  Peaks were matched across samples using the density method with a bw=5 and mzwid=0.025 and retention time correlated using the obiwarp algorithm with profStep=0.5. Missing peak data was filled in the peaklists generated from the ADB tolerant ash leaf samples compared to the peaklists generated from the ADB susceptible leaves. The resulting peaklists were annotated using the Bioconductor R package, CAMERA [2]. The peaks were grouped using 0.05% of the width of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and groups correlated using a p-value of 0.05 and calculating correlation inside and across samples. Isotopes and adducts were annotated using a 10 ppm error.
</p>
Statistical analysis and modelling was performed using MetaboAnalyst v3.0 [3] with the following parameters. Features with 50% or more missing values were automatically removed and replaced using a missing value estimation corresponding to half of the minimum positive value in the original data. Data was filtered (40%) to remove non-informative variables using the interquartile range (IQR).  Samples were normalised using the internal standard d5-IAA (POS: M181T1448; NEG: M179T1382). Data was transformed using auto scaling.
