Study Title	"Deep functional analysis of synII, a 770 kb synthetic yeast chromosome"
Study Description	"Here we report the design, construction and characterization of a 770 Kb synthetic yeast chromosome II (synII). With the UPLC-MS method, we demonstrated synII maintains a nearly wild-type phenotype and fitness despite hundreds of designer editing to it. Our phenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics data futher supports the identity of synII and wild one."

Study Protocol Description	"BY4741 and SynIIv1.2 (strain ID: YS031) strains with 3 biological replicates were cultured overnight in 3 ml YPD medium at 30 °C and further incubated in 10 ml fresh YPD medium until the OD600 reached ~0.8."	"The culture broth was partitioned into two sample sets, one was used for global metabolomics analysis, while the other was for lipidomics analysis, and quenched immediately with -40 °C methanol.  After being centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, cell pellet was collected and stored at -80 °C until the subsequence extraction process. The extraction methods were conducted according to the method described previously for lipodomics [1] and metabolomics [2]. Precooled methanol/water (2 ml, 1:1, v:v) was added to those samples for global metabolomics analysis or isopropanol/water (3:1, v:v) for lipidomics analysis, vortexed for 1 min and the extraction mixture was then carried out by sonication at 200 W for 20 min on ice. After being centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min, the supernatant was transferred into a new microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 15000 rpm at 4 °C for a further 5 min before analysis using an Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of ﬂigh ((UPLC-QTOF)/MS) LC-MS/MS system. A quality control (QC) sample, which represents the sample batch, was prepared by combining 40 μl of each sample.</br>

"	"A BEH C18 column (2.1×100 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters) and CSH T3 C18 column (2.1×100 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters) were used for global metabolomics and lipidomics analysis, respectively. The binary solvent system includes acetonitrile and water for global metabolomics, acetonitrile/water (60:40,v/v) and isopropanol/acetonitrile (90:10,v/v) for lipidomics. The additive regent was 10 mM NH4Ac for global metabolomics and 10 mM NH4Ac/0.1% HCOOH for lipidomics. The gradient elution was as follows: global metabolomics; acetonitrile %=3-3-60-75-100-100-3-3(0-0.5-4-6-6.1-8-8.1-10 min), and lipidomics; isopropanol/acetonitrile acetonitrile % =40-43-50-54-70-99-40-40(0-2-2.1-6-6.1-8-8.1-10 min). The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min, and the inject volume was 10 μl."	"Mass spectra were collected on XEVO-G2XS QTof mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI)  source. The positive and negative ionization mode parameters were as follows: capillary voltage 0.45 kV (global metabolomics)/ 2.00 kV (lipidomics) ; source temperature 120 °C; deconvolution temperature 500 °C; the cone and deconvolution gas (N2) flows were 50 V  and 800 l/h, respectively. The instrument was operated in MSE mode and data were collected in centroid mode. Leucine enkephalin (MW = 555.62) (200 pg/μl in acetonitrile/water 50:50) was used as a lock mass for accurate mass measurements instrumental drift correction and 0.5 mM sodium formate solution was used for calibration. Mass spectra of the metabolites were operated in centroid mode with in the mass range of 50-1200 m/z for global metabolomics and 50-2000 for lipidomics in two channel, MS and MSE. The low energy MS channel was conducted in 6.0 eV of collision energy and MSE channel included an energy ramp of 20-40 eV (metabolomics)/ 19-45 eV (lipidomics). Ten QCs were injected at the beginning to condition the column, and to investigate the repeatability of the data one QC was inserted and analyzed every ten samples.
"	"The raw data were processed by Progenesis QI 2.0 data analysis software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK) for peak picking, alignment, and normalization to produce peak intensities for retention time and m/z data pairs. Further statistical analysis was performed on the resulting normalized peak intensities using in-house developed software metaX  (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/metaX.html). In metaX processing, the metabolic features  that are detected in <50 % of QC samples or <80 % of true samples were removed. In addition, all metabolic features with a variable coefficient (CV) RSD, as calculated for the QC samples, of >30 % were also removed."	"Metabolite identification was conducted by comparing Progenesis Metascope from Progenesis QI 2.0 against the Yeast Metabolome Database 1.0 with mass tolerance of 10 ppm for precursors."
