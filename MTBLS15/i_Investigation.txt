Study Title	"Metabolomic responses to long-term salt stress in related Lotus species (B)"
Study Description	"The legume genus Lotus includes glycophytic forage crops and other species adapted to extreme environments, such as saline soils. Understanding salt tolerance mechanisms will contribute to the discovery of new traits which may enhance the breeding efforts towards improved performance of legumes in marginal agricultural environments. Here, we used a combination of ionomic and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolite profilings of complete shoots (pooling leaves, petioles and stems) to compare the extremophile Lotus creticus, adapted to highly saline coastal regions, and two cultivated glycophytic grassland forage species, Lotus corniculatus and Lotus tenuis. L. creticus exhibited better survival after exposure to long-term lethal salinity and was more efficient at excluding Cl- from the shoots than the glycophytes. In contrast, Na+ levels were higher in the extremophile under both control and salt stress, a trait often observed in halophytes. Ionomics demonstrated a differential rearrangement of shoot nutrient levels in the extremophile upon salt exposure. Metabolite profiling showed that responses to NaCl in L. creticus shoots were globally similar to those of the glycophytes, providing little evidence for metabolic pre-adaptation to salinity. This study is the first comparing salt acclimation responses between extremophile and non-extremophile legumes, and challenges the generalization of the metabolic salt pre-adaptation hypothesis."

Study Protocol Description	"L. creticus seeds were kindly provided by the Servicio Devesa-Albufera Ayuntamiento de Valencia, Viveros Municipales de El Saler, CV-500, Km 8.5, El Saler, Valencia (Spain). L. corniculatus var. San Gabriel and L. tenius (Lotus glaber) var. La Esmeralda were obtained from the LOTASSA consortium (http://www.lotassa.com). Seeds were germinated in plates containing half-strength BD agar [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. For the evaluation of survival to long-term lethal NaCl levels, seedlings (at least 40 of each species) were transplanted to pots containing a mixture of sand and perlite (1:1) irrigated with nutrient solution, and grown in the greenhouse under a 16/8 h day/night, 23 ± 2 °C and 55–65% relative humidity regime. Eight days post-imbibition, the salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in 25 mm NaCl steps every three days to reach 300 mm NaCl. This concentration was used to continue irrigation, until all the plants died. The number of dead plants as a function of time was recorded. Plants were scored dead when the whole plant or all the leaves were wilted or chlorotic. For the gradual salt stress acclimation experiments, seedlings were transplanted to soil (type Null Einheitserde, Wandorf, Germany) and irrigated with nutrient solution. The stress treatment was started 8 days post-imbibition. The salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in three steps of 4 day intervals from 50, 100 to 150 mm NaCl [2]. In two successive independent experiments, L. creticus was tested parallel to the other Lotus species. Each independent experiment included sample sets of control and salt-treated plants. Each sample set had at least five independent biological replicates and each replicate was a pool of at least five plants. The total duration of the cultivation was 32 d. Complete shoots, pools of leaves, petioles and stems omitting cotyledons were harvested in situ in the middle of the light period and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The experimental design induced neither senescence nor was lethal within the cultivation period. At harvest, all plants were still in the vegetative stage and non-nodulated. Biomass was estimated by the mean fresh weight of the pooled shoot samples.

</p>
Injection of a 1 µl sample is performed at 230 °C in splitless mode with helium carrier gas flow set to 0.6 ml/min. Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended.
</p>
The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 °C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 °C/min ramp to 350 °C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow. The transfer line temperature is set to 250 °C and matches ion source conditions.

The n-alkanes used to calculate are retention time index were as follows: decane, dodecane, pentadecane, octadecane, nonadecane, docosane, octacosane, dotriacontane, hexatriacontane. For additional information on the retention time index calculations see [1].
