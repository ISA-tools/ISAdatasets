Study Title	"Direct infusion mass spectrometry metabolomics dataset: a benchmark for data processing and quality control"
Study Description	"Direct-infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) metabolomics is an important approach for characterising molecular responses of organisms to disease, drugs and the environment. Increasingly large-scale metabolomics studies are being conducted, necessitating improvements in both bioanalytical and computational workflows to maintain data quality. This dataset represents a systematic evaluation of the reproducibility of a multi-batch DIMS metabolomics study of cardiac tissue extracts. It comprises of twenty biological samples (cow vs. sheep) that were analysed repeatedly, in 8 batches across 7 days, together with a concurrent set of quality control (QC) samples. Data are presented from each step of the workflow and are available in MetaboLights. The strength of the dataset is that intra- and inter-batch variation can be corrected using QC spectra and the quality of this correction assessed independently using the repeatedly-measured biological samples. Originally designed to test the efficacy of a batch-correction algorithm, it will enable others to evaluate novel data processing algorithms. Furthermore, this dataset serves as a benchmark for DIMS metabolomics, derived using best-practice workflows and rigorous quality assessment."

Study Protocol Description	"Fresh sheep (Ovis aries; n=10) and cow (Bos primigenius taurus; n=10) heart tissue was obtained from a local abattoir less than 4 miles away, packed on ice and driven back to the laboratory where it was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Portions of heart tissue were dissected and weighed (52 mg ± 2.6 mg) before storing at -80 °C until extraction. Since the purpose of the study was to assess the analytical reproducibility of a DIMS metabolomics study, no data was collected on the sex, breed or origin of the tissue supplied."	"Low molecular weight metabolites were extracted from each cardiac tissue using a methanol / chloroform / water solvent system (final solvent ratio 2:2:1.8) as described previously [1]. Briefly, pre-weighed frozen tissue was homogenised in 8 ml/g of ice-cold methanol and 2.5 ml/g of ice-cold water in Precellys homogenisation tubes containing ceramic beads. The homogenate was transferred to 1.8 ml glass vials to which 8 ml/g chloroform and 4 ml/g water were added. Samples were vortexed and placed on ice for 10 mins before the biphasic mixture was centrifuged at 1800 g for 10 mins. After 5 mins at room temperature, ten 15 µl aliquots of the polar layer were transferred into ten 1.8 ml glass vials, dried in a centrifugal evaporator (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY) and stored at -80 °C until analysis. Further tissue from the same anatomical region of the same twenty hearts was extracted as one pool and then aliquoted in 100 µl aliquots to make ten identical QC samples.

Samples were centrifuged at 15000-g at 4 °C for 10 mins to remove particulate matter. Metabolomic analyses were conducted in positive ion mode using a hybrid 7-T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (LTQ FT Ultra, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a chip-based direct infusion nanoelectrospray ion source (Triversa, Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY). Nanoelectrospray conditions comprised of a 200 nl/min flow rate, 0.3 psi backing pressure and +1.7 kV electrospray voltage controlled by ChipSoft software (version 8.1.0). Mass spectrometry conditions included an automatic gain control setting of 1 x 106 and a mass resolution of 100,000 (at 400 m/z). Analysis time was 2.25 minutes (per technical replicate), controlled using Xcalibur software (version 2.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Spectra were collected using the SIM stitching method, i.e. acquisition of seven overlapping selected ion monitoring (SIM) mass ranges between 70 and 590 Da in 100 Da windows, each with a 30 Da overlap with its neighbouring window [1]. This SIM stitching method has previously been shown to increase metabolome coverage compared to a traditional wide-scan approach, while providing high mass accuracy and a rapid sample throughput. For each replicate of each sample, data was collected as both proprietary-software-processed .RAW mass spectral files (Dataset 1: Instrument .RAW files) and as multiple individual transient files (i.e. signal intensity in the time domain).

"The averaged FT-ICR transient data were Hanning apodised, zero-filled once and Fourier transformed using the FFT algorithm to convert them from a time to frequency domain."	"The individual files from the processing transients stage (Dataset 3:Frequency spectra) were further processed using a custom written Matlab code to peak pick and mass calibrate [1].  Peaks were selected based on using a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) threshold of 3.5:1, such that only peaks with a SNR value above this threshold were considered real, and retained in the dataset. Next, a calibration step was applied to convert the frequency domain to m/z values and finally the seven individual SIM windows per replicate were combined "stitched" into one file comprising frequency, intensity, resolution and SNR of each peak .  Three regions of electronic noise were removed (corresponding to m/z 74.00 to 74.05, 90.44 to 90.49, and 101.7 to 101.9) and a maximum peak distance of 1.5 ppm was used for alignment of peaks.

Using custom written Matlab code, for each sample [1], the m/z lists for the triplicate replicates were filtered to a single 'combined' peak list according to this criteria: a peak must be present in at least two out of three replicates (for that sample) to be retained.  A peak alignment maximum distance of 1.5 ppm was used here (i.e., only peaks with measured masses that were less than 1.5 ppm apart were considered to be the same peak).

This step consisted of using a custom written Matlab code to label and remove peaks from the biological samples that were also present in the blank samples; specifically, a threshold was set such that the peak was considered a contaminant if it had an intensity in the blank sample that was one-third or more of the intensity of the same peak in the biological samples.  This allowed for high intensity peaks of biological origin to be retained, even if there was a much lower intensity coincident contaminant peak. Next, 'sample filtering' was applied, which amalgamates the individual biological sample spectra into a data matrix according to this criteria: a peak must be present in at least 80% of the biological samples to be retained. A peak alignment maximum distance of 2.5 ppm was used here, i.e., only peaks with measured masses that were less than 2.5 ppm apart were considered to be the same peak."	"The output matrix from sample filtering (Dataset 7: Sample filtered peak matrix) was normalised using probabilistic quotient normalisation [1] to reduce any variance arising from subtly differing dilutions of the biological extracts.

PMID: 16808434"	"A batch correction algorithm (Quality control-robust spline correction (QC-RSC)) was applied to Dataset 8a: SFPMPQN to reduce intra- and inter- batch variation. QC-RSC is written in Matlab (version R2011a, The MathWorks, Natick, MA) and requires the Statistics and Curve fitting toolboxes."	"Three "spectral cleaning" algorithms were applied to Dataset 8b: SFPMPQN+BATCH+KNN dataset (yielding Dataset 8c: SFPMPQN+BATCH+CLEAN) [1]. First, a peak was removed if the relative difference between the median QC sample intensity compared to the median biological sample intensity was inconsistent between batches. This phenomenon is indicative of a failure to detect that peak in the QC samples, within one or more batches (tested using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test for comparison of batch medians, after signal correction, with a critical p-value of 0.0001). As such the peak as a whole must be considered unreliable and removed. In the second spectral cleaning algorithm, a peak was removed if the difference between the median QC sample intensity and the median biological sample intensity was relatively large (tested using non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, with critical p-value set empirically to 1x10-14). This phenomenon indicates that the QC samples are not in fact representative of the average of the biological samples, perhaps due to degradation. Finally, a peak was removed if its RSDQC value was >20%; i.e. the analytical reproducibility of the peak was considered too high.
