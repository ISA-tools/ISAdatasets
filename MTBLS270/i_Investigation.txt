Study Identifier	"MTBLS270"
Study Title	"A new method for quantitative determination of bitter components of Belgian endive, with a focus on sesquiterpene oxalates."
Study Description	"The sesquiterpene lactones typical of the genera Cichorium and Lactuca were historically thought to be present in the free and glycosylated form, but recent developments have highlighted the presence of highly unusual oxalyl esters. In this work, first a liquid chromatography method that requires minimal sample preparation and can measure both free and conjugated sesquiterpene lactones was developed. Then the most common sample preparation techniques used in the past studies (e.g., solid-phase extraction, liquid/liquid extraction) were evaluated and shown to introduce significant bias against the polar oxalyl-terpenes. Finally the method was applied to a case study, highlighting the effect of variety, duration and temperature of forcing on the sesquiterpene lactone content of Belgian endive."

Study Protocol Description	"Belgian endive was field-grown and forced at the experimental station Inagro vzw (Rumbeke-Beitem, Belgium). Three varieties were used in this study: Takine, Symphonie, and Vintor. Roots were harvested on 19/11/2013, and subsequently forced following an experimental design including three forcing temperatures (11, 16, and 21 ˚C) and three forcing periods (14, 21, and 28 d). The combinations of 14 d at 11 ˚C and 28 d at 21 ˚C were not implemented as they would not produce chicons fit for consumption. Forcing started on 27/5/2014 (for 28 days of forcing), 3/6/2014 (21 days) or 10/6/2014 (14 days). All chicons were harvested on 24/6/2014 and kept refrigerated at 4 ˚C. During the two following days, ten chicons were randomly chosen per condition for sampling. After removing the two external leaves, the remaining leaves were separated from the pit with a knife, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder in a CryoMill grindomixer MM200 (Retsch, Germany). Samples were kept in dry ice for transport to the lab, and stored subsequently at  80 °C until analysis."	"For each sample (commercial), 300 mg of crushed frozen leaves was weighed in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube, to which 1.4 ml of extraction solvent was added. Extraction solvent was prepared by adding 1 ml of formic acid and 100 µl of acetonitrile containing 20 mg/ml of α-santonin to 1 l of HPLC water. Extraction was performed under continuous shaking at 30 °C for 15 min in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf brand, VWR, Belgium), followed by centrifugation at 2000 x g at 4 °C for another 15 min. Exactly 1 ml of the supernatant was filtered through a 13 mm x 0.2 µm PTFE disc filter in a glass vial and injected in the HPLC-MS."	"High performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) separation was performed using a modified Alliance 2695 system (Waters, Belgium). The following modifications were applied: a) all the internal tubing was replaced with custom cut, burr-free electropolished stainless steel tubes of 0.254 mm I.D. (Valco Vici, Schenkon, Switzerland) with the only exception being the tube leading to the primary pump head from the gradient valve (0.508 mm I.D.), b) the eluent filter placed after the pumps was removed, c) the original sample loop was replaced with a 30 µl PEEK-lined stainless steel tubing (IDEX Health & Science, Germany), d) a 25 µl syringe (Hamilton, Switzerland) was installed, and e) a 100 µm I.D. PEEK tubing was placed between injector and column, and between column and detector.
</p>
A  Kinetex C18 (2.1 mm I.D. x 150 mm length x 5 µm particle diameter, core shell silica) column, coupled to an adequate precolumn of the same diameter and stationary phase, were used in this study (Phenomenex, the Netherlands). The column oven was kept at 40 °C and injection volume was 5 µl. The HPLC was run in gradient mode according to the following table:
</p>
from 0 to 15 min: linear gradient from 5 to 53% B, 0.2 ul/min</br>
from 15 to 19 minutes: isocratic 100% B, 0.5 ul/min</br>
from 19 to 23 min: isocratic 5% B, 0.5 ul/min
</p>
solvent A: water + 0.1% formic acid
solvent B: acetonitrile"	"A Micromass QTof Micro (Waters, Belgium) directly connected to the column outlet was used as the MS detector. The optimized values for the positive mode were as follows: capillary voltage: 3100 V, sample cone: 24 V, extraction cone 1 V, desolvation temperature: 450 ˚C, desolvation flow: 600 l/h, no cone flow, source temperature: 110 ˚C, collision energy: 3 V.  Acquisition parameters were: scan time: 0.4 s, inter-scan time: 0.1 s, reference scan (leu-enkephalin): 60 s, centroid mode, centroid threshold: 1, minimum point: 5. Integration was performed over EICs with a window of 0.02 Da around the target ion. The mass spectrometer was tuned to a resolution of 5500. Its performance was monitored daily by calibrating with a solution of sodium formate prepared according to the manufacturer’s specifications, and ensuring that the residuals of the polynomial calibration were under 5 mDa. Deadtime correction (Np factor) was calculated separately for positive and negative mode by injecting increasing concentrations of leu-enkephalin and empirically measuring the correct value."	"Mass-locked data was acquired with MassLynx 4.1 and the raw files converted with DataBridge (part of the MassLynx suite)."	"The analytes were quantified by integrating in MassLynx and reporting their raw area. The peaks specified in the metabolite identification table are those used for quantification (either [M+H]+ or [M+Na]+).
</p>
Lactucin was identified on the basis of an authentic standard. Lactucin oxalate and lactucopicrin oxalate were identified based on the data of Sessa et al. [1]. Other sesquiterpenes were identified on the basis of accurate mass, isotope pattern, and mass spectra similarity to those described in literature (including regular series of neutral losses).
