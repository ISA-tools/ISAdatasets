Study Title	"Relative influence of early life exposure, host genetics and diet on gut microbiome and metabolome"
Study Description	"The gut microbiome is known to play important roles in host physiology, health and disease. Yet we lack a clear understanding of how interactions between host genetics and early life environment impact the composition of an individual's gut microbiome, and the metabolic and phenotypic consequences on host fitness. To address this issue we leveraged the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse system, and discovered that early life history has a profound impact on microbiome composition, whereas dietary changes have only a moderate effect. The early life microbial signature remained distinguishable for at least two generations, even after transferring the mice into an alternative built environment. By contrast, the gut metabolome was shaped mostly by diet, with specific non-dietary metabolites explained by the microbial community's metabolic potential. Quantitative trait analysis identified mouse genetic trait loci (QTL) that impacted abundances of gut microbiome components, specifically members of the Clostridiales, Deferribacterales, Anaeroplasmatales, Bifidobacteriales and Lactobacillales orders. Human orthologs of these genes have been implicated in gastro-intestinal cancer, while other mouse QTLs contained genes implicated in arthritis, rheumatic disease and diabetes, which were significantly correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillales. Furthermore, Lactobacillales abundance was correlated with host T-helper cell counts, suggesting an impact on host immunity. Correlations between specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and B-cell counts, body weight and neuromuscular function (rotarod performance) were also observed. This study is the first to determine and rank the complex contributions of built environment, host genetics and diet in shaping gut microbial and metabolite composition, host fitness and behavior."

Study Protocol Description	"Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse strains were obtained from UNC Chapel Hill and handled under an approved IACUC protocol.  For each of 30 strains, two males and two females were housed separately and maintained on PicoLab Rodent Diet 20 (5053). All mice were maintained on the same water and food sources. Fecal samples were collected from each strain at 12 weeks of age. Mice from the same 30 CC strains were then transferred to a LBNL to investigate the stability of the gut microbiome in response to a new environment. Fecal samples were collected from each cage 24 hrs after cage change at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after arrival at LBNL. Fecal samples were stored at -80 °C for downstream metabolite and microbial analyses. Genotyping data for all CC mice was obtained from UNC (http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py).
"	"Metabolites were extracted from mouse fecal samples taken 12 weeks after birth and 8 weeks after transfer to LBNL using a methanol/sonication method. Briefly, portions of the homogenized samples were weighed and extracted with cold (-20 °C) methanol proportionally (1 ml solvent per 100 mg homogenate) in a microcentrifuge tube. The average weight of the homogenized fecal samples was 69.3 ± 26.3 mg (mean ± standard deviation). 100 µl of each methanol extract was transferred to glass vials and dried in a speed-vac concentrator (Labconco CentriVap Benchtop Vacuum Concentrator; Kansas City, MO). Dried metabolite extracts were chemically derivatized using a modified version of the protocol used to create FiehnLib. Briefly, dried metabolite extracts were dried again to remove any residual water if they had been stored at -80 °C. To protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric isomers, 20 µl of methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg/ml) was added to each sample, followed by vortexing for 30 s and incubation at 37 °C with generous shaking (1000 rpm) for 90 min. At this point, the sample vials were inverted one time to capture any condensation of solvent at the cap surface, followed by a brief centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min.  To derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms, 80 µl of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1 % trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) were then added to each vial, followed by vortexing for 10 s and incubation at 37 °C with shaking (1000 rpm) for 30 min. Again, the sample vials were inverted one time, followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min."	"A HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies, Inc) was used for untargeted metabolomics analyses. The sample injection mode was splitless, and 1 µl of each sample was injected. The injection port temperature was held at 250 °C throughout the analysis."	"An Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Inc; Santa Clara, CA) was used, and the samples were blocked and analyzed in random order for each Experiment. The GC oven was held at 60 °C for 1 min after injection, and the temperature was then increased to 325 °C by 10 °C/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325 °C. The helium gas flow rates for each Experiment were determined by the Agilent Retention Time Locking function based on analysis of deuterated myristic acid and were in the range of 0.45-0.5 ml/min. Data were collected over the mass range 50 - 550 m/z. A mixture of FAMEs (C8-C28) was analyzed once per day together with the samples for retention index alignment purposes during subsequent data analysis."	"Agilent .D files were converted to netCDF format using Agilent Chemstation, followed by conversion to binary files using Metabolite Detector."	"GC-MS raw data files were processed using the Metabolite Detector software, version 2.5 beta. Retention indices (RI) of detected metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of the FAMEs mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all analyses after deconvolution. Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to an augmented version of FiehnLib (i.e., the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites), using a Metabolite Detector match probability threshold of 0.6 (combined retention index and spectral probability). All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to eliminate false identifications. The NIST 08 GC-MS library was also used to cross validate the spectral matching scores obtained using the Agilent library and to provide identifications of unmatched metabolites (Level 2 identifications). The three most abundant fragment ions in the spectra of each identified metabolite were automatically determined by Metabolite Detector, and their summed abundances were integrated across the GC elution profile; fragment ions due to trimethylsilylation (i.e. m/z 73 and 147) were excluded from the determination of metabolite abundance."
