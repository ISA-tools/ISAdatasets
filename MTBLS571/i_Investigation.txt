Study Title	"Grazer-induced transcriptomic and metabolomic response of the chain-forming diatom Skeletonema marinoi."
Study Description	"Diatoms and copepods are main actors in marine food webs. The prey-predator interactions between them affect bloom dynamics, shape marine ecosystems and impact the energy transfer to higher trophic levels. Recently it has been demonstrated that the presence of grazers may affect the diatom prey beyond the direct effect of grazing. Here, we investigated the response of the chain-forming centric diatom Skeletonema marinoi to grazer cues, including changes in morphology, gene expression and metabolic profile. S. marinoi cells were incubated with Calanus finmarchicus or with Centropages typicus and in both cases responded by reducing the chain length, whereas changes in gene expression indicated an activation of stress response, changes in the lipid and nitrogen metabolism, in cell cycle regulation and in frustule formation. Transcripts linked to G protein-coupled receptors and to nitric oxide synthesis were differentially expressed suggesting involvement of these signalling transduction pathways in the response. Downregulation of a lipoxygenase in the transcriptomic data and of its products in the metabolomic data also indicate an involvement of oxylipins. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the gene function in diatoms, providing information on the nature of genes implicated in the interaction with grazers, a crucial process in marine ecosystems."

Study Protocol Description	"Females of Calanus finmarchicus were picked from plankton samples collected near Tjärnö Island in the North Sea (Sweden; 58°N51’ – 11°E7’) and maintained in filtered sea water until the next morning when experiments started. Skeletonema marinoi strain V32, isolated from a germinated resting stage originating from surface sediment near the Vinga island in the Skagerrak, was cultivated in F2 medium in 2 l-Pyrex® sterile bottles and kept in exponential growth by daily dilutions until use. Photoperiod and irradiance were 12L:12D (16L:8D) and ~80 µmol photos/m^2/s.
</p>
10 2-l un-grazed Pyrex® control bottles and 10 C. finmarchicus exposed cultures with initial S. marinoi cell concentration set at 10,000 cells/ml were set up and 10 copepods were added to each copepod bottle. The bottles were filled to the rim, closed with cellophane film to prevent spilling and air bubbles, and mounted on a rotating wheel (1 rpm). The experiments always started at 6.00 pm.
</p>
Samples were collected at 2 time points, after 65 and 89 hr from introducing copedpods into the bottles (T1 and T2, respectively). At each time point, 5 controls and 5 treated samples were collected, and copepods were removed from the samples using a sieve (68 µm mesh size)."	"The samples were extracted by filtering the diatom culture with Whatman® glass fiber filters (GF/F) (Sigma - Aldrich s.r.l.). Filters were washed in methanol before use, and once filtration completed were put in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes on ice and submerged in 1 ml of ice cold methanol. Eppendorf tubes were vortexed for 30 s and stored at -80 °C until further use. Before metabolite profiling, 300 µl of each sample was dried down under a stream of nitrogen and resolved in 60 µl LC-MS grade methanol to obtain a five-fold concentration of the sample."	"Chromatographic separations were performed with an Agilent 1100 HPLC coupled to an Agilent Q-TOF 6540 mass spectrometer. The samples were separated on a Licrosphere 2.1 x 150 mm, 3 µm C18 silica column (Poroshell, Agilent) using an eluent gradient. The flow rate was 0.35 ml/min and the mobile phases were 0.1% acetic acid in water (=A) and 0.1% acetic acid and 2% isopropanol in acetonitrile (=B). The solvent gradient was: 98% A to 98% B in 20 min, 98% B for 5 min, 98% B to 98% A in 1 min, 98% A for 4 min (all solvents LC/MS grade). The injection volume was 4 µl. Quality control (QC) samples, prepared by combining equal aliquots of all samples within a sample occasion, were included to monitor LC-MS platform reproducibility."	"Mass spectra were obtained in negative mode in 4 GHz high resolution mode with 2 spectra/s for masses between 80 and 1400 m/z. Electro spray ionization at 300° C with 8 l/min drying gas, and nebulizer pressure 40 psi, sheath gas flow and temperature were set at 11 l/min and 350° C. Nozzle voltage 0 V, and skimmer voltage 65 V."	"Raw mass spectra data files were deconvoluted by the Batch Recursive Feature Extraction algorithm of Agilent MassHunter Profinder software (MH Profinder, version B.06.00). The algorithm is divided into 2 parts and first groups of co-variant ions are located, each group representing a unique feature. The features are defined as time-aligned ions (i.e. isotopes, adducts and/or dimers) summarized to the calculated neutral mass, possess an abundance and a retention time (RT), and are treated as compounds. We allowed for –H and CH3COO adducts, and a neutral loss of H2O. Compounds with absolute peak heights of 20000 or higher and occurring in at least 3 of 5 samples within at least 1 treatment were selected for compound alignment (RT window = 0.3 min, mass tolerance = 5 ppm + 2 mD). The second part of the algorithm creates a composite list of ions for the aligned compounds and performs a recursive, targeted analysis of raw data. This step reduces false-positive and false-negative detection rates generated in the first untargeted feature extraction. The settings for adduct ions, neutral mass, and aggregates (i.e. dimers) were the same as for the first extraction. The chromatograms of the resulted aligned compounds were visually inspected in MH Profinder and reintegrated when needed (e.g. double peaks were occasionally aligned wrongly). As a final filter only compounds occurring in all samples within at least 1 treatment were considered and the final peak list was exported as a text file for statistical analysis. For calculations of elemental compositions of specific metabolites, the molecular formula generator (MFG) algorithm included in the Agilent MassHunter Workstation software was used. MFG uses a wide range of MS information including accurate mass measurements, isotope abundances, and spacing between isotope peaks to produce a list of candidate molecular formulas that are ranked according to their relative probabilities. Data was normalised to biovolume from coultercounts before multivariate analysis to avoid confounding effects of grazing."	"The resulted raw data were processed and aligned to generate a list of features (hereafter referred to as “metabolites”) consisting of retention time and molecular masses. alculations of elemental compositions were only performed on metabolites with a neutral mass lower than 500 Da. The metabolic response of Skeletonema to copepod grazing was analysed with multivariate data analysis, using the software SIMCA (version 13.0.0.0, Umetrics, Sweden). Principal component analysis was used to generate an overview and to analyse for systematic differences in metabolite content between treatments."
