Study Title	"A multi-omic profiles of fruits regarding the maturation of Olive (Olea europaea L.) (GC-MS assay)"
Study Description	"<div>Olive (Olea europaea) has a long history of medicinal and nutritional values own to it rich in polyphenol and fatty acids (FAs) in fruits. In order to better understand the biosynthesis important of these metabolites, we generated comprehensive Iso-Seq full-length and illumina RNA-seq transcriptome, and targeted metabolomics dataset of different olive fruits maturity. The targeted metabolomics by using both GC/MS and LC/MS were totally quantified 35 FAs and 13 polyphenols. Iso-Seq library was constructed and sequenced by PacBio Sequel System, and a total of 5,891,652 (10.55 G) with an average length of 1,791 subreads were obtained. 492,350 circular consensus sequences (CCSs) were formed after merging and error correction through subread comparison. Of the 492,350 CCSs, 399,263 were found to be full-length non chimera (FLNC) reads, and 187,517 consensus reads were finally obtained by using clustering algorithm of Iterative clustering for error (IEC). These multiomics data provide a foundation to elucidate the mechanisms regulating biosynthesis of polyphenol and FAs during the maturation of olive fruits.</div><div><br></div><div><div><b>GC-MS</b> protocols and data are reported in the current study <b>MTBLS855</b>.</div><div><br></div><div><b>UPLC-MS</b> protocols and data associated to this study are reported in <b><a href=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS814>MTBLS814</a></b>.<br></div></div>"

Study Protocol Description	"<div><span _ngcontent-c15='' class='ng-star-inserted'><span _ngcontent-c34='' class='fadeIn animated ng-star-inserted'>The 15-year-old Olive (<i>Olea europaea L.</i>)
 trees were grown in the garden of Research Institute of Forestry,
Chinese Academy of Forestry in Longnan Gansu province of China. The
fruit samples were collected at 5 developmental stages: 50, 80, 110, 140
 and 170 days after flowering (DAF).</span></span></div>"	"2 mL of 2% Sodium hydroxide methanol solution were added to the plant samples weighing approximately 50 mg  refluxing for 15min in a water bath at 80 °C. 5 ml 2% sulfuric acid-methanol solution was added, and then, the samples were esterificated for 15min in a water bath at 80 °C. In addition, 10 mL ultrapure water was added to stop the reaction and 5 mL n-hexane was added to extract.The supernatant was absorbed and diluted 20 times.500 μL of the supernatant was taken, 25μL of internal standard (IS) then was added, and the mixture solution was transferred into a GC vial for GC-MS analysis."	"The 7890A GC (Agilent) instrument was fitted with a capillary column Agilent HP-INNOWAX (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 μm) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and helium was used as the carrier gas at 1 ml/min. Injection was made in splitless mode with an injection volume of 1 μl and an injector temperature of 250 <span _ngcontent-c17='' class='ng-star-inserted'><span _ngcontent-c36='' class='ng-star-inserted'>°C</span></span>. The temperature of the ion source, auxiliary heater, and quadrupole were 230, 250, and 150 °C, respectively.
The column temperature was programmed to increase from an initial temperature of 50 °C, which was maintained for 3 min, followed by an increase to 220 °C at 10 °C/min, which was maintained for 4.5 min, and finally to 250 °C at 15 °C/min and held at this temperature for 2.5 min."	"The mass spectra were collected on a 5975C MSD (Agilent). The detector was operated in electron impact ionization mode (electron energy 70 eV) using single ion monitoring (SIM) mode."	"No data transformation was reported in this study"	"Matched retention time and characteristic ion peaks between standard and sample.
<br><br>
The calibration graphs were constructed by plotting analyte-to-IS peak area ratio versus theoretical concentration for each individual fatty acid.  35 calibration curves yielded correlation coefficients (r) higher than 0.990."
