Study Title	"Non-invasive urinary metabolomic profiling identifies diagnostic and prognostic markers in lung cancer"
Study Description	"Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, yet there is currently a lack of diagnostic noninvasive biomarkers that could guide treatment decisions. Small molecules (<1500 Da) were measured in urine collected from 469 lung cancer patients and 536 population controls using unbiased liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Clinical putative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers were validated by quantitation and normalized to creatinine levels at two different time points and further validated in an independent sample set, which comprises 80 cases and 78 population controls, with similar demographic and clinical characteristics when compared to the training set. Creatine riboside (IUPAC name: 2-{2-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-oxolan-2-yl]-1-methylcarbamimidamido}acetic acid), a novel molecule identified in this study, and N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA), were each significantly (P <0.00001) elevated in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and associated with worse prognosis (hazard ratio (HR) =1.81 [P =0.0002], and 1.54 [P =0.025], respectively). Creatine riboside was the strongest classifier of lung cancer status in all and stage I–II cases, important for early detection, and also associated with worse prognosis in stage I–II lung cancer (HR =1.71, P =0.048). All measurements were highly reproducible with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.82 – 0.99. Both metabolites were significantly (P <0.03) enriched in tumor tissue compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue (N =48), thus revealing their direct association with tumor metabolism. Creatine riboside and NANA may be robust urinary clinical metabolomic markers that are elevated in tumor tissue and associated with early lung cancer diagnosis and worse prognosis."

Study Protocol Description	"Urine samples from 469 NSCLC patients prior to treatment and 536 population controls collected from 1998 to 2007 from the greater Baltimore, Maryland, area were employed as a training set. Population controls were identified from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) lists and frequency-matched to cases by age, gender, and self reported race."	"Urine samples were diluted with an equal volume of 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing debrisoquine (ESI+ internal standard) and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (ESI- internal standard). Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to precipitate proteins."	"A 5 µl sample was chromatographed on a 50 x 2.1 mm Acquity BEH 1.7 µm C18 column (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) using an Acquity UPLC system (Waters). To avoid artifacts based on sample injection order, the order was randomized. The gradient mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (B). A typical 10-min sample run (at 0.5ml/ml) consisted of 0.5 min of 100% solvent A followed by a linear gradient to 80% A at 4 min, to 5% A at 8 min. After a 0.5 min wash step, the column was equilibrated to initial conditions for 1.5 min."	"The eluent was introduced by electrospray ionization into the mass spectrometer (Waters QTOF Premier) operating in positive (ESI+) or negative (ESI-) ionization mode. The capillary and sampling cone voltages were set to 3,000 and 30 V, respectively. Source and desolvation temperatures were set to 120 ºC and 350 ºC, respectively, and the cone and desolvation gas flows were set to 50.0 and 650.0 l/h, respectively. To maintain mass accuracy, sulfadimethoxine at a concentration of 300 pg/µl in 50% acetonitrile was used as a lock mass and injected at a rate of 50 µl/min. For MS scanning, data were acquired in centroid mode from 50 to 850 m/z and for tandem MS the collision energy was ramped from 5 to 35 V."	"In the NCI-MD cohort, chromatograms were first visually inspected using Waters MassLynx to ensure their quality and 12 samples were removed due to poor quality (e.g. undetectable spiked in control, break in signal). All subsequent data analyses were performed using R, a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R package XCMS2, version 1.22.1, was utilized to extract and align peaks for all detected metabolites. Peak areas for all signals were extracted using the following criteria: ppm=25, mzdiff=-0.005, snthresh = 10, scanrange=c(1,500), peakwidth=c(5,12), prefilter=c(1,30)). Retention times were aligned using one iteration of the rector() function using the loess method, which performs smoothing of the retention time deviations for every time point in each sample. Peaks were then found using the group() function with the following parameters: bw=10, minfrac=0.1, mzwid=0.01. Next, ESI+ and ESI- signals were merged on lung cancer cases and healthy control samples that were in common between both sets (N = 1257) and signals with masses that had a ppm error larger than 50 were removed from further analysis. This filtering reduced the total number of signals from 2756 and 1804 to 1807 and 1359, for ESI+ and ESI- modes, respectively. Next, a normalization algorithm analogous to MSTUS (MS 'total useful signal')3 normalization was applied. Signals that are putative xenobiotics (e.g., acetaminophen) were removed before calculating the scaling factor using the following criteria: signals with very high abundance (> 90th percentile) in at most 100 samples and with very low abundance (<= 20th percentile) in at least 800 samples. Scaling factors, total intensity counts for each sample divided by the mean total intensity counts of all samples, were then used to normalize signal abundances. Finally, signals with variation (measured by coefficients of variation) between duplicates higher than variations between randomly selected sample pairs were removed."	"Identification of biomarkers was initiated by searching their high accuracy masses in METLIN and HMDB databases. If no database hits were returned, spectral interpretation of the MS/MS product ion mass and MS3 spectra were used to generate putative structures. Metabolite identity was confirmed by comparing retention times and product ion mass spectra and by monitoring characteristic fragmentation patterns in multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode against those of commercially available and in-house synthesized standards."
