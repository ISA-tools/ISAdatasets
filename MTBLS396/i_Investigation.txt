J Lipid Res 49, 1137-1146 (2008)): 1.5 mL methanol and 5 mL MTBE (methyl-tert-butyl ether) were added to liver homogenate in 12 mL glass test tubes with PTFE-lined caps, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min in an overhead shaker at room temperature. After addition of 1.25 mL deionized water and 10 min of additional shaking, the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 x g and the upper phase was transferred to a new test tube. The lower phase was re-extracted with 2 mL of the upper phase of MTBE/methanol/deionized water 10:3:2.5 (v/v/v). The upper phases were combined, evaporated in a vacuum centrifuge and dissolved in 1 mL chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v) for storage at  -20 °C. Animal procedures were approved by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science and Research and the Ethics Committee of the University of Graz (BMWFW-66.007/0006-WF/3b/2014).

The Orbitrap Velos Pro hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was operated in Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode using a HESI II (heated electrospray ionization) ion source. Prior to experiments, lens settings and source parameters were optimized to the signal of PE 34:1 (using protonated/deprotonated molecular ion in positive/negative ion mode, respectively) infused into the column effluent of 80 % mobile phase B with a mixing tee. Ion source parameters for positive polarity were as follows: Source Voltage 4.5 kV; source temperature 375 °C; sheath gas 25 arbitrary units (AU); aux gas 9 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 °C. Ion source parameters for negative ion mode were: Source voltage 3.8 kV; source temperature 325 °C; sheath gas 30 AU; aux gas 10 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 °C. Full scan spectra from m/z 400 to 1,000 for positive ion mode and from m/z 400 to 1,000 in negative ion mode were acquired at a target resolution of 100,000 (FWHM at m/z 400). From each full scan spectrum, ions were selected for sequential fragmentation either in the linear ion trap (collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments) or in the C-trap (higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) experiments) and detected in the ion trap or the Orbitrap analyzer, respectively. For CID experiments, the 10 most abundant ions of the full scan spectrum were fragmented using He as collision gas (isolation width 1.5 m/z; activation Q 0.2; activation time 10 ms). Normalized collision energy was 50 in both positive and negative ion mode. For HCD experiments, fragment spectra of the 4 most abundant ions were collected in the Orbitrap mass analyzer at a target resolution of 7,500 (FWHM at m/z 400, isolation width 1.5 m/z; activation time 0.1 ms). Exclusion time (duration after fragmentation for excluding ions with similar m/z) was set to 10 s. Normalized collision energy settings were 25 and 50 for positive and negative ion mode, respectively.

4000 QTRAP:
The 4000 QTRAP (AB Sciex, Concord, Canada) was controlled by Analyst v. 1.6.1 software and operated in Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) mode, using an enhanced MS (EMS) scan from m/z 400 to 1,050 and 400 to 1,000 in positive and negative ion mode, respectively, at 1,000 Da/s as a survey scan. Prior to analysis, source parameters were optimized using flow injection analysis into an isocratic flow of 80 % mobile phase B. Analytes were PC 36:1 (m/z 788.6-184) for positive ion mode and PE 36:2 (m/z 742-279) for negative ion mode. The optimized source parameters of the Turbo V ion source for positive ion mode were as follows: Curtain gas 15 AU; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 5,000 V; temperature 450 °C; gas 1 50 AU; gas 2 50 AU; declustering potential 60 V; collision energy spread 0; collision energy 45 V.

Full scan spectra in the range of m/z 400 to 1,050 were acquired at a target resolution of 120,000 (FWHM at m/z 400). The four most abundant ions from each spectrum were subjected to fragmentation in the C-trap, and the tandem mass spectra were recorded at a target resolution of 15,000 (FWHM at m/z 400). Isolation width was 1.5 m/z, activation time was 0.1 ms, normalized collision energy was 25 in positive ion mode and 50 in negative ion mode, and the exclusion time was 15 s.

QTRAP 6500:
The QTRAP 6500 (AB Sciex, Concord, ON, Canada), controlled by Analyst v. 1.6.2 software, operated in IDA mode, using an EMS scan from m/z 400 to 1,000 at 10,000 Da/s as a survey scan. Source parameters were automatically optimized using flow injection analysis into an isocratic flow of 80 % mobile phase B. Analytes were PC 34:1 (m/z 760-184) for positive ion mode and PE 34:1 (m/z 716-281) for negative ion mode. The optimized source parameters of the Turbo V ion source for positive ion mode were as follows: Curtain gas 20 AU; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 5,000 V; temperature 300 °C; gas 1 30 AU; gas 2 30 AU; declustering potential 100; collision energy spread 0; collision energy 45 V.

QTOF G6550A:
The Agilent G6550A QTOF mass spectrometer was operated in AutoMSMS mode. From the full scan spectra, acquired from m/z 100 to 1,700 at a rate of 4 spectra/s, tandem mass spectra of the 15 most abundant precursor ions were acquired at a scan rate of 20 spectra/s and a collision energy setting of 30. Previously detected target ions were excluded after three spectra for 9 s. Source parameters for positive and negative ion mode were as follows: Gas temperature 200 °C; gas flow 14 AU; nebulizer 35 AU; sheath gas temperature 350 °C; sheath gas flow 11 AU; capillary voltage 3,500 V; nozzle voltage 1,000 V; fragmentor 175; skimmer 65; octopole RF peak 750.

Q Exactive:
The Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) was operated in DDA mode. Ion source parameters for positive polarity were as follows: Spray voltage 4.5 kV; aux gas heater temperature 375 °C; sheath gas 35 AU; aux gas 10 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 320 °C. Ion source parameters for negative ion mode were: Spray voltage 3.8 kV; aux gas heater temperature 325 °C; sheath gas 40 AU; aux gas 20 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 °C. For both positive and negative ion mode, full scan spectra from m/z 400 to 1,050 were acquired at a target resolution of 140,000 (FWHM at m/z 200) from which ions were selected for fragmentation. Automatic gain control (AGC) target was set to 1e6 ions and the maximum injection time to 500 ms. For the DDA MS/MS scan for both positive and negative ion mode, target resolution was set to 17,500 (FWHM at m/z 200), AGC target to 5e4 ions, maximum injection time to 50 ms and isolation window to 1.5 m/z. The 10 most abundant ions from the full scan spectra were selected for the MS/MS scan. Normalized collision energy was 25 for positive ion mode and 30 for negative ion mode."	"Data was transformed by msconvert to mzXML, and by LDA in chrom format."	"MS1 peaks were identified as described in Hartler, J. et al. (Bioinformatics. 27, 572-577, 2011), and MS/MS spectra were interpreted by decision rule sets as described in the referenced paper of this study.

For the metabolites assignment, a pipe "|" was used to discriminate between the individual MS runs, while comma "," was used to account for several identifications (e.g. several retention times) and ambiguous identifications (e.g. DG 20:0/18:0/-,20:0/-/18:0 corresponds to a diacylglyceride where 20:0 is identified to be on the sn-1 position, while 18:0 might be at sn-2 or sn-3)."
