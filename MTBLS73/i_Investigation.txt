STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS73"
Study Title	"Metabolic differences in ripening of Solanum lycopersicum 'Ailsa Craig' and three monogenic mutants ( alternative assay to MTBLS36 ESB Tomatoes)"
Study Description	"The purpose of this study was to highlight metabolic differences between different cultivars of tomato through development and ripening. Application of mass spectrometry enables the detection of metabolic differences between groups of related organisms. Differences in the metabolic fingerprints of wild-type Solanum lycopersicum and three monogenic mutants, ripening inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Colourless non-ripening (Cnr), of tomato are captured with regard to ripening behaviour. A high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry system coupled to liquid chromatography produced a time series of the ripening behaviour at discrete intervals with a focus on changes post-anthesis. Internal standards and quality controls were used to ensure system stability. Original information, see MTBLS36"

Study Protocol Description	"The tomato cultivars were as follows: WT wild type (Ailsa Craig or AC++) NOR monogenic mutant of NOR mutant (same as WT except for non ripening locus) RIN monogenic mutant of RIN (ripening inhibited) CNR monogenic mutant of CNR (colourless non-ripe) Each tomato was sampled at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 40 days after anthesis (flowering), the breaker stage, which is when the fruit first starts to change colour and at several days post ripening. The breaker stage occurred at approximately 47 days (+/- 1 day). Code Days BR 47 BR+1 48 BR+2 49 BR+3 50 BR+4 51 BR+5 52 BR+6 53 BR+7 54"	"ESB Tomato samples were subjected to an untargeted metabolite analysis by LCMS for Polar extracts. For polar extracts approximately 30mg of dried tomato tissue was extracted with ethanol:water 20:80 for Apolar extracts 20:80 methanol:chloroform was used."	"Waters Acquity UPLC system: The non-targeted LC-MS/MS method used a Waters HSS T3 150 x 2 mm, 1.7 µm, Acquity UPLC column. The solvents used for the assay consisted of 0.2% Formic Acid (Solvent A) and 98/2/0.2 Acetonitrile/Water/Formic Acid (Solvent B). The gradient started at 100% A (hold 2.5 min) at 0.25 ml/min followed by a gentle ramp to 10% B after 7.5 min increasing the flow rate of 0.4 ml/min; then to 100% B after 10 min, hold 2 min, before equilibrating back to starting conditions after 18 min."	"The mass spectrometer was scanned from 85-900 Da (positive ion scans) and 95-900 Da (negative ion scans). Data dependent MS/MS spectra were obtained to aid in the identification of the components detected. The two most intense mass spectral peaks detected in each scan were fragmented to give MS2 spectra and the two most intense signals in each of these spectra were further fragmented to give MS3 spectra. Full scan data was acquired in the profile mode to ensure compatibility with the Genedata Refiner-MS™ processing software and MS/MS spectra were acquired in the centroid mode for identification purposes. The experimental procedure is fully described in the report “Targeted and Non-Targeted Analytical Procedure for Metabolomics in Analytical Sciences” by Dave Portwood 2010."	"Non-targeted LC-MS datafiles were initially pre-processed using the Genedata Expressionist Refiner MS™ program. After data extraction and identification the data was analysed using a combination of multivariate and univariate methods in order to highlight differences between the ripening profiles of four different cultivars of tomato. Multivariate analysis was conducted using the SIMCA-P 12 software from Umetrics and the univariate analysis was completed using the R-Language for statistical computing. Overview of Data Processing The LC-MS Data were processed using the Genedata RefinerMS package to align, de-noise and convert three-dimensional data into peak tables. Mass spectral searching using NIST 2.0 software allowed identification of a number of peaks. Subtotalling and normalisation of the data was carried out in Microsoft Excel and Multivariate Analysis in SIMCA-P. The R language for statistical computing was also used to generate Univariate comparisons."	"Annotation of LC-MS/MS metabolite peaks was performed by searching two mass spectral libraries; Thermo MassFrontier ver 5 mass spectral MS-MS library and an in-house prepared mass spectral library."
