Study Title	"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-Based Blood Metabolic Profiles of Rats Exposed to Short-Term Caloric Restriction"
Study Description	"Caloric restriction increases life-span of a number of organisms. The relationship between the increase in life-span and the extent of caloric restriction, however, varies among species. The underlying mechanisms are yet unknown, but appear to be related to changes in metabolism. In order to investigate the metabolic response of caloric restriction of rats, here is presented the first nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based study of how blood metabolite profiles are influenced by graded levels of caloric restriction. The study involved three groups of obese rats exposed to 0, 20, and 40% caloric restriction for five days. Blood serum from each individual was analyzed by 1H NMR and the resulting spectra were subjected to multivariate analysis by unsupervised principal component analysis and supervised orthogonal-partial least square discriminant analysis. The analyzes revealed that a response to caloric restriction was present at 20% caloric restriction. The metabolites that distinguished the profiles at 20% restriction deviated from those at 40% restriction. The changes induced by caloric restriction were most clearly observed as an increased level of 3-hydroxybutyrate, and decreased levels of lipids and pyruvate. The metabolic responses of rats exposed to caloric restriction are in good agreement with a switch in metabolism from anabolic pathways towards fatty acid catabolism and gluconeogenesis, which is consistent with previous observations for mice."

Study Protocol Description	"Diet-induced obesity was established in 13 month old female Wistar rats (Scanbur AB, Sollentuna, Sweden) by providing free access to a high energy diet for three months as previously described [1]. Water was freely available at all times. The rats were subjected to a 12/12 hr light/dark regime, and the room temperature was held between 20 and 23 °C. The rats were later randomly allocated to one of two groups (n = 5), receiving 20 or 40% caloric restriction. Food rations were calculated from the baseline food consumption prior to the restriction period. A third group (n = 5) continued to receive food in unrestricted amounts (0% caloric restriction) and served as controls. Caloric restriction was sustained for five days after which the rats were decapitated. Blood serum was prepared by allowing blood to clot before being centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min. Serum was stored at -80 °C until analysis.

"The samples were analyzed on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer using a 5-mm 1H/13C/15N/31P QNP probe at 25 °C."	"The water suppressed spin-echo Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence (relaxation delay-90-(t-180-t)n-acquire) was used to allow attenuation of broad signals from macromolecules, with a total CPMG time of 105 ms (n = 128). Spectra were recorded using 512 transients with 32k data points and a spectral width of 6410 Hz. Water suppression was achieved by irradiation during the relaxation delay of 3 s."	"All spectra were processed with Topspin 2.0 (Bruker). A zero-filling factor of 2 and a line-broadening of 0.5 Hz were applied to the spectra. Phasing was done automatically, followed by manual phasing if necessary, and baseline correction was automatically performed by subtraction of a polynomial of 5th degree. The signal of the anomeric proton of alpha-glucose was used as a reference (delta 5.233 ppm)."	"Spectral signals were assigned by comparison of chemical shifts with values from the literature ([1][2][3][4] and from the Chenomx library (Chenomx NMR Suite 7.5, Chenomx Inc., Alberta, US). In order to support the assignment of metabolite signals, 1H,1H-TOCSY (total correlation spectroscopy) and 1H,13C- HSQC (heteronuclear single-quantum coherence) were run on selected samples, which were then fortified with expected metabolites. DOSY (diffusion ordered spectroscopy) experiments were performed to differentiate signals from lipoproteins of different sizes [4][5].
