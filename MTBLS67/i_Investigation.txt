Study Title	"Metabolomic Analysis of Fission Yeast at the Onset of Nitrogen Starvation"
Study Description	"Microorganisms naturally respond to changes in nutritional conditions by adjusting their morphology and physiology. The cellular response of the fission yeast S. pombe to nitrogen starvation has been extensively studied. Here, we report time course metabolomic analysis during one hour immediately after nitrogen starvation, prior to any visible changes in cell morphology except for a tiny increase of cell length per division cycle. We semi-quantitatively measured 75 distinct metabolites, 60% of which changed their level over 2-fold. The most significant changes occurred during the first 15 min, when trehalose, 2-oxoglutarate, and succinate increased, while purine biosynthesis intermediates rapidly diminished. At 30–60 min, free amino acids decreased, although several modified amino acids—including hercynylcysteine sulfoxide, a precursor to ergothioneine—accumulated. Most high-energy metabolites such as ATP, S-adenosyl-methionine or NAD+ remained stable during the whole time course. Very rapid metabolic changes such as the shut-off of purine biosynthesis and the rise of 2-oxoglutarate and succinate can be explained by the depletion of NH4Cl. The changes in the levels of key metabolites, particularly 2-oxoglutarate, might represent an important mechanistic step to trigger subsequent cellular regulations."

Study Protocol Description	"The fission yeast S. pombe heterothallic haploid 972 h- wild-type strain was used for the experiments. Cells were incubated in the EMM2 liquid medium at 26 °C in a water bath with shaking. Cell concentration in the culture was measured by the CDA-500 particle counter (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). For metabolome analysis, cells were grown to the log phase and at the concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml, 40 ml of culture was taken as 0 min sample. The rest of culture was N-starved by switching the medium with EMM2-N (EMM2 without NH4Cl) following the procedures previously described [1]. After N-starvation, cells were incubated again in the water bath at 26 °C, and after 15, 30, 60 min, 40 ml of culture was taken.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at -20 °C and a constant amount of internal standards (10 nmol of HEPES and PIPES) was added to each sample. Cells were disrupted using a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan). Proteins were removed by filtering on an Amicon Ultra 10-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and samples were concentrated by vacuum evaporation. Finally, each sample was resuspended in 40 µl of 50% acetonitrile and 1 µl was used for each LC-MS injection."	"LC-MS data were acquired using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, AL, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). LC separation was performed on a ZIC-pHILIC column (Merck SeQuant, Umeå, Sweden; 150 × 2.1 mm, 5 µm particle size). Acetonitrile (A) and 10 mM ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 9.3 (B) were used as the mobile phase, with gradient elution from 80% A to 20% A in 30 min and 100 µl/min flow rate."	"Mass spectrometer was operated in full scan mode with the scan range of 100-1,000 m/z. Each sample was analyzed twice, once in negative and once in positive ionization mode."	"Raw LC-MS data were analyzed by the MZmine 2 software. The complete workflow and processing parameters are summarized in the publication."	"Metabolites were identified by comparing their m/z values and retention times with authentic pure standards, as described in the publication."
