Study Title	"Enhancement of oxidative and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis by overaccumulation of antioxidant flavonoids."
Study Description	"The notion that plants use specialized metabolism to protect against environmental stresses needs to be experimentally proven by addressing the question of whether stress tolerance by specialized metabolism is directly due to metabolites such as flavonoids. We report that flavonoids with radical scavenging activity mitigate against oxidative and drought stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. Metabolome and transcriptome profiling and experiments with oxidative and drought stress in wild-type, single overexpressors of MYB12/PFG1 (PRODUCTION OF FLAVONOL GLYCOSIDES1) or MYB75/PAP1 (PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1), double overexpressors of MYB12 and PAP1, transparent testa4 (tt4) as a flavonoid-deficient mutant, and flavonoid-deficient MYB12 or PAP1 overexpressing lines (obtained by crossing tt4 and the individual MYB overexpressor) demonstrated that flavonoid overaccumulation was key to enhanced tolerance to such stresses. Antioxidative activity assays using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, methyl viologen, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine clearly showed that anthocyanin overaccumulation with strong in vitro antioxidative activity mitigated the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in vivo under oxidative and drought stress. These data confirm the usefulness of flavonoids for enhancing both biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in crops."

Study Protocol Description	"Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) plants were used as the wild type in this study. MYB12OX and pap1-D were described previously[1][2]. Homozygous WOX1-1 and WOX1-2 were prepared by crossing MYB12OX and pap1-D, followed by self-fertilization of the F1 generation. Two progenies, exhibiting both Basta and kanamycin tolerance in the F2 and F3 generations, were obtained and named WOX1-1 and WOX1-2. The homozygous MYB12OX/tt4 and pap1-D/tt4 lines were prepared by crossing MYB12OX or pap1-D with tt4, respectively. Progenies that exhibited both Basta and kanamycin tolerance (F2 and F3 generations) were obtained. Sterilized seeds were kept for 2 days at 4°C in the dark and were sown on plates of growth medium (GM) agar containing 1% sucrose[3]. Black paper was used for wrapping the plates used for the light-shielding condition. All plates were set in a growth chamber at 22 °C and a relative humidity of approximately 60% under a 16-h light (approximately 40 µmol/s/m^2)/8-h dark cycle. The drought stress experiment was conducted at 21 °C and 40 ± 5% relative humidity under 16 h/8 h light/dark conditions in a plant growth room. Harvested plant samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use.
