Study Title	"1H NMR Metabolomics Identifies Underlying Inflammatory Pathology in Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial Joints"
Study Description	"Despite osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) being typically age-related, their underlying etiologies are markedly different. We used 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to identify differences in metabolite profiles in low volumes of OA and RA synovial fluid (SF). SF was aspirated from knee joints of 10 OA and 14 RA patients. 100 μL SF was analyzed using a 700 MHz Avance IIIHD Bruker NMR spectrometer with a TCI cryoprobe. Spectra were analyzed by Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software. Statistical analysis was undertaken using Metaboanalyst. 50 metabolites were annotated, including amino acids, saccharides, nucleotides and soluble lipids. Discriminant analysis identified group separation between OA and RA cohorts, with 32 metabolites significantly different between OA and RA SF (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Metabolites of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were lower in RA compared to OA; these results concur with higher levels of inflammation, synovial proliferation and hypoxia found in RA compared to OA. Elevated taurine in OA may indicate increased subchondral bone sclerosis. We demonstrate that quantifiable differences in metabolite abundance can be measured in low volumes of SF by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which may be clinically useful to aid diagnosis and improve understanding of disease pathogenesis."

Study Protocol Description	"Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fluid (SF) from knee joints was aspirated into heparinized tubes and processed within 1 hr. Aliquots of whole SF were centrifuged at >2000 x g for 5 min and cell-free SF was decanted and frozen at -20 °C."	"No extraction was performed in this study."	"100 µl of synovial fluid (SF) was thawed out over ice and diluted to a final volume containing 50% (v/v) SF, 40% (v/v) dd H2O (18.2 M), 10% (v/v) 1 M PO4(3-) pH 7.4 buffer (Na2HPO4, VWR International Ltd., Radnor, Pennsylvania, USA and NaH2PO4, Sigma-Aldrich) in deuterium oxide (2H2O) and 0.0025% (v/v) sodium azide (NaN3, Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were then vortexed for 1 min, centrifuged at 13,000 x g and 4 °C for 2 min and 190 µl transferred (taking care not to disturb any pelleted material) into 3 mm outer diameter NMR tubes using a glass pipette."	"1D 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance III HD 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TCI cryoprobe at pH 7.4 and 37 °C."	"1D 1H standard CPMG-type metabolomics experiment with optimal water suppression was acquired with the cpmgpr1d filters for small molecules via a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence. Spectra were acquired with 32 transients, a 15 ppm spectral width, 32k points, 9.6 ms echo time, a 3.1 s acquisition time, and a 4 s interscan delay."	"Automated data processing, Fourier transformation, and phasing were carried out in Topspin v3.5 software using standard Bruker routines. The spectra were then normalised to the median and bucketed per peak into a matrix of metabolite peak intensities using AMIX v3.9.14."	"Chenomx v8.2 software used for initial metabolite identification with manual confirmation to in-house standards for metabolite peaks found to be significantly variable. 
</p>
Statistical test:</br>
The prepared bucket table was subjected to univariate and multivariate analysis. Student T-test were applied on the spectra after determining the data were parametric using ggplot function in R. Unsupervised multivariate analysis of the spectra was carried after out using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The data was scaled by mean centering of each variable followed by division of the square root of the standard deviation (Pareto scaling) before analysis."
