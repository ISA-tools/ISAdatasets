Study Protocol Description	"Reference standards were commercially purchased from Fluka Analytical, Sigma-Aldrich, and C/D/N Isotopes or prepared in-house. Stock standard solutions were prepared for the analytical reference standards at a concentration of 1000 µg/ml in 20/80 HPLC analytical grade Ethanol/Water and then diluted 10x for injection."	"Not applicable."	"All samples were run on a Waters Acquity® UPLC system (Waters Corporation, USA), HSS T3 150 x 2 mm, 1.7 µm particles, UPLC column at 30 °C oven temperature. The solvents used for the assay consisted of 0.2% Formic Acid (Solvent A) and 98/2/0.2 Acetonitrile/Water/Formic Acid (Solvent B). Gradient [time (min) / %B] starting at flow rate 0.25 ml/min: 2.5/0, 7.5/10 (flow rate to 0.4 ml/min), 10.0/100, 12.0/100, 18.0/0, 25.0/0. Aliquots of 2 µl were injected."	"The compounds were detected using a Thermo LTQ Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer operating in positive and negative Electrospray ionization (ESI) mode at a resolution of 30,000 with a scan range from 85-900 m/z and 95-900 m/z respectively. MS/MS spectra were obtained in a data dependent manner through higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD, normalized collision energy: 50.0) at a resolution of 7,500: The two most intense mass spectral peaks detected in each scan were fragmented to give MS2 spectra (100-900 m/z). Full scan data was acquired in FT (accurate mass) mode, MS/MS spectra were acquired in centroid mode. The LTQ Velos Orbitrap used the Xcalibur control software version 2.1.0 for data acquisition."	"Raw files were converted to mzML format using the ProteoWizard (http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/) with 'Peak Picking' for MS1. The resulting mzML files were processed with MassCascade (https://bitbucket.org/sbeisken/masscascadeknime/wiki/Home). Processing included noise reduction, deconvolution, annotation, and identification of signals relevant to the metabolite standard"	"Annotation of LC-MS/MS metabolite peaks was performed by searching an in-house prepared mass spectral library and manual curation taking into account both MS levels. All metabolite standards have identified M+H or M-H peaks, and were identified by their accurate mass, isotope pattern, putative fragments in MS1, and MS2 fragments. The 'fragmentation' columns holds a clearly identified fragment peak in MS1. A fragment peak is clearly identified if it can be rationalized via a fragmentation pattern, e.g., loss of CO2, has a positively correlated mass chromatogram, and - if possible - a (weak) isotope pattern."
