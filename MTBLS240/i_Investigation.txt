Study Title	"Maslinic acid-enriched diet decreases intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice through transcriptomic and metabolomic reprogramming."
Study Description	"Chemoprevention is a pragmatic approach to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in western countries. In this regard, maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene extracted from wax-like coatings of olives, is known to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines without affecting normal intestinal cells. The present study evaluated the chemopreventive efficacy and associated mechanisms of maslinic acid treatment on spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice. Twenty-two mice were randomized into 2 groups: control group and MA group, fed with a maslinic acid-supplemented diet for six weeks. MA treatment reduced total intestinal polyp formation by 45% (P<0.01). Putative molecular mechanisms associated with suppressing intestinal polyposis in Apc(Min/+) mice were investigated by comparing microarray expression profiles of MA-treated and control mice and by analyzing the serum metabolic profile using NMR techniques. The different expression phenotype induced by MA suggested that it exerts its chemopreventive action mainly by inhibiting cell-survival signaling and inflammation. These changes eventually induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, the metabolic changes induced by MA treatment were associated with a protective profile against intestinal tumorigenesis. These results show the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of MA against intestinal tumor development in the Apc(Min/+) mice model, suggesting its chemopreventive potential against colorectal cancer."

Study Protocol Description	"A total of 22 male 4-week-old ApcMin/+ mice were purchased and maintained in the animal facility at the University of Barcelona. Animal care was strictly in accordance with the European Union Regulations, and the experimental protocols were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethical Research Committee of the University of Barcelona in accordance with current regulations for animal care and use for experimental purposes. After a 7-day acclimatization period receiving the standard diet (Teklad Global 18% Protein rodent diet), animals were randomly divided into two groups of 12 and 10 mice per group (Control and maslinic acid (MA), respectively). Control mice were fed with the standard diet, and the MA-treated group was fed with the same diet supplemented with 100 mg of MA/kg feed in order to mimic the effective concentration inhibiting colon cancer cell growth[1]. Animals were maintained for 12 h light/dark cycles, with free access to water and food. Throughout the 6-week treatment period, animals were observed for any signs of toxicity. At the end of the 6 weeks, the animals were starved overnight and anesthetized with volatile isoflurane (ESTEVE, Barcelona, Spain) before blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture. Immediately, blood was centrifuged at 600 x g at 4 °C for 10 min to obtain serum samples, which were frozen at -80 ºC until processing. After blood extraction, mice were killed by an overdose of anesthesia. Maslinic acid (MA) extract used was a white powder comprising 98% maslinic acid and 2% oleanolic acid.

Next, serum samples were thawed and then filtered using the previously prepared centrifugal devices and spun at 9000 x g at 4 °C for 45 min. Then, 150 µl of the filtrate was diluted to obtain a 600 µl NMR sample in buffer (60 mmol/l sodium phosphate, 10 mmol/l sodium azide, 0.5 mmol/l TMSP, 10% D2O, pH 7.0).

"The samples were analyzed using a Bruker 500 spectrometer operating at 500.18 MHz with a 5 mm triple resonance probe at 25 ºC."	"One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were obtained by using 128 transients, 16 steady-state scans, a spectral width of 6009 Hz, 8192 pairs data points, and a 4.3 s recycling time. Excitation sculpting was used for water suppression."	"The data were processed in NMRLab[1]. An exponential line-broadening function of 0.3 Hz was applied, and the dataset was zero-filled to 16384 data points prior to Fourier transformation. Spectra were phase-corrected manually and referenced to TMSP (at 0 ppm). To compare peak volumes, the total area of each spectrum, excluding the regions containing the residual water signal and the TMSP signal, was normalized to 1.
