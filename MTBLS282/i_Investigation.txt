Study Identifier	"MTBLS282"
Study Title	"3D DESI mass spectrometry imaging of 51 serial sections from a human liver metastasis"
Study Description	"51 serial sections from a single human liver metastasis are made available in this dataset. Four neighbouring sections were placed on a single slide and analysed together. The tissue sections were analysed by desorption electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) according to the procedure outlined in the associated GigaScience publication. The data files are made available in centroid- and profile-mode imzML format. Additionally, high- and low-resolution H&E-stained optical images are included."

Study Protocol Description	"The human adenocarcinoma sample was excised during a surgical operation performed at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust.  The sample and procedures were carried out in accordance with ethical approval (11/LO/0686)."	"The tissue specimen was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a freezer at -80 °C prior to cryosectioning at 10 µm thickness using a Microm HM550 Cryostat (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Runcorn, UK) set at -16 °C, and thaw mounted onto SuperFrost® Glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Distilled water was used to mount the sample to the sample holder, and the cryosectioning was performed without embedding medium. The built-in vacutome function of the cryostat was used to facilitate sectioning. The slides were stored in closed containers at -80 °C prior to analysis and allowed to thaw at room temperature under nitrogen flow prior to DESI-imaging MS acquisition. Sections were cut to a thickness of 10 µm, and every tenth section was imaged. The instrumental spatial resolution of 100 µm resulted in voxels of 100 cubic µm. Four sections were placed on each slide in this order: 1) top right; 2) bottom right; 3) bottom left; 4) top left, i.e. proceeding clockwise from the top right."	"DESI imaging was performed in negative ion mode over an m/z range of 150 - 1,500 using a Thermo Exactive instrument (Thermo Scientific GmbH, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a home-built automated DESI-imaging source as described previously [1]. The solvent used for DESI analysis was methanol/water (95/5 v/v) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Nitrogen was used as a nebulizing gas at a pressure of 7 bar. The distance between the DESI spray tip and the sample surface was set to 1.5 mm; the distance between the DESI spray tip and the mass spectrometer was set to 14 mm; and the distance between the inlet capillary and the sample surface was 0.1 mm. The spray angle was 80°, whereas the collection angle was fixed at 10°. The spray voltage used for analysis was 4.5 kV. Each row of pixels was acquired as a continuous line scan over the sample surface and saved in a separate raw file.

Additionally there is an area of connective tissue containing blood vessels and bile ducts.
</p>
The stained images typically require to be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise in order to match the MS data."	"All Thermo raw files of one imaging experiment were then converted to imzML format using the imzML converter v1.1.4.5i [1]. The imzML files were named with reference to the section number and location of the section on the slide. For example, in the file named “120TopL, 90TopR, 110BottomL, 100BottomR-centroid.imzML”, the top-right section was the 90th section cut from the sample at a depth of 900 µm.
