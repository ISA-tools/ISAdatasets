Comment[Submitted Name]	Application of Histone Interacting Domains as an Alternative to Antibodies (CIDOP-seq)
Experiment Description	Application of Histone Modification Interacting Domains (HMIDs) as an Alternative to Antibodies. HMIDs and antibodies (taken from ENCODE) were used for precipitation of native chromatin (mononucleosomes) in order to study distinct histone marks. HMIDs used in this study are MPP8 Chromo domains and ATRX ADD (as H3K9me3 binders), Dnmt3a PWWP (as H3K36me3 binder) and CBX7 Chromo (as H3K27me3 binder).
