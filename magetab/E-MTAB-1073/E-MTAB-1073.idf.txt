Protocol Description	3C material was generated using BglII as a restriction enzyme. The bait fragment (Chr7: 150474507-150484686, NCBIM37) encompasses the whole KvDMR1, and was enriched by streptavidin pulldown of a biotinylated primer extension product using primer KvDMR-4C-ext as described in Schoenfelder et al., 2010. 	The 4-cutter Csp6I was used to cut within the prey region and create uniform ends for adapter ligation. A SNP at Chr7:150474522 (B6: T, SD7: C) was used to discriminate between alleles.	Sequencing was performed as paired-end reads on the Illumina GAIIx platform. The first read (38 bp) contained 4C prey fragments and the second read (76 bp) contained a barcode as well as the allele-specific 4C KvDMR bait.    	Sequence pairs were screened for presence of bait in the second read and sorted according to sample and allelic origin. The prey end sequence reads used as input for ASAP (which uses Bowtie for alignments) were 38 bp and alignments were performed allowing 2 mismatches (ASAP parameters: -q --phred64-quals -n 2 -l 38 -k 2 --best --chunkmbs 256). SD7 mice carry M. spretus sequence at the distal end of chromosome 7. A ‘partial M. spretus genome’ for use in ASAP was assembled by using BAC sequences (CH35_ 17P24, CH35_35H19, CH35_76I5, CH35_123K8, CH35_374F13, CH35_391C2). The M. musculus (B6) and M. spretus sequences differ not only by an array of SNPs, but also by various structural variations. ASAP takes all these variations into account and returns a subset of reads which are specific for one particular allele.
