Experiment Description	Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) definitive phage type 104 (DT104) has caused significant morbidity and mortality in humans and animals for almost three decades. We have completed the full DNA sequence of one DT104 strain, NCTC13348 and show that the main differences between the genome of this isolate and the previously sequenced S. Typhimurium LT2 lie in integrated prophage elements and the Salmonella Genomic Island 1 encoding antibiotic resistance genes. Thirteen isolates of S. Typhimurium DT104 with different pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles were analyzed by multi locus sequence typing (MLST), plasmid profiling, hybridization to a Pan-Salmonella DNA microarray and prophage-based multiplex PCR. All the isolates belonged to a single MLST type ST19. Microarray data demonstrated that the 13 DT104 isolates were remarkably conserved in gene content. The PFGE band-size differences in these isolates could be explained to a great extent by changes in prophage and plasmid content. Thus, here the nature of variation in different S. Typhimurium DT104 isolates is further defined at the genome level illustrating how this phage type is evolving over time.

Protocol Description	The bacterial strains used in this study include clinical and field isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 from diseased and healthy animals or patients, as well as the strain S. Typhimurium DT104 P247529 (Colindale) used as control reference in the microarray work. The resistance of most animal isolates to the following compounds was known: Ciprofloxacin, Naladixic acid, Tetracylin, Chloramphenicol, Trimethoprim, Kanamycin, Streptomycin, Hexane, Cyclohexane. Strains that were resistant to three or more antibiotcs were termed Multiple Drug Resistant (MDR) and that showing resistance to cyclohexane and antibiotics were termed multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR). The breakpoints defining resistance are detailed in Randall et al. [Randall LP, Cooles SW, Sayers AR, Woodward MJ. (2001). Association between cyclohexane resistance in Salmonella of different serovars and increased resistance to multiple antibiotics, disinfectants and dyes. J Med Microbiol. 50:919-24.]	For preparation of genomic DNA, cells were grown overnight in LB broth at 37C	For preparation of genomic DNA, cells were grown overnight in LB broth at 37&deg;C and DNA was isolated using QIAGEN DNeasy Tissue Kit (no.69504, QIAGEN) or the CTAB (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, Sigma-Aldrich Ltd) method.

Cy Labelling<br> <br> Notes:  - Always use gloves, separate solutions and special tubes/tips  when working with RNA!<br>         - Protect Cy dyes from light exposure as much as possible!<br> <br> 1.      Set temperature blocks to 100 C and 37 C (or waterbath). Place all  required reagents and samples on ice (experimental and reference gDNA  random primer, Superscript enzyme, buffer and Cy dyes). <br> 2.     Mix 21 ul of gdna solution with 20 ul of 2.5X random primer/reaction buffer mix from BioPrime kit (Gibco/BRL)<br> 3.      Incubate the reaction mixtures at 100 C for 5 min. Place Cy dye on  ice for step 6.<br> 4.      Snap-chill the tubes on ice. Spin down reaction mixtures for 15  sec and place the tubes on ice.<br> 5.      On ice add 5 ul of 10X dNTP mix (1.2 mM each dATP, dGTP and dTTP and 0.6mM dCTP in 10mM tris 8.0, 1mM EDTA)<br> 6.      Add 3 microlitres of dCTP Cy-labelled  nucleotide to each tube. Remember which dye you use for experiment vs  reference to bear in mind the forward/reverse dye swap, if any. Change tips between tubes.  Keep exposure to light of Cy dyes to minimum.<br> 7.      Add 1 microlitre of Klenow enzyme from the BioPrime kit taken freshly from freezer. Make sure that there  is no drop outside of tip after taking enzyme. Change tips between tubes.  When enzyme gets low, spin down briefly before use. Put enzyme back to  freezer immediately after use.<br> 8.      The total volume of the reaction mixture should now be 50  microlitres. Vortex reactions and spin down for 15 sec.<br> 9.      Incubate the reactions at 37 C for 2 h. Cover with lid for  light protection.<br> 10.     Add 5 ul of BioPrime Kit stop buffer.<br> 11.     Prepare AutoSeq G-50 columns (Amersham), 1 to 2 columns for each labeling reaction:   <br> -       Resuspend the resin in the column by vortexing gently. <br> -       Loosen the cap 1/4th turn and snap off the bottom closure.<br> -       Place the column in a 1.5 ml screw-cap microcentrifuge tube for  support. Alternatively, cut the cap from a flip-cap tube and use this tube  for support.<br> -       Spin the column for 1 min at 2000 x g. Start the timer and the  centrifuge simultaneously. Use the column immediately after preparation to  avoid drying of the matrix. <br> 12.     Purify the labeled cDNA as follows:<br> -       Place the column in a new 1.5 ml tube and slowly apply the sample  to the centre of the angled surface of the compacted resin bed, being  careful not to disturb the resin. Do not allow any of the liquid to flow  around the sides of the bed. <br> -       Spin the column for 1 min at 2000 x g. Start the timer and  microcentrifuge simultaneously. The purified sample is collected at the  bottom of the tube. Discard the column.<br> 13.     Pool purified experimental cDNAs with corresponding reference  cDNAs<br> 14.     Add 1/10th volume of 3M NaAc pH 5.2 (11 microlitres) and 3 volumes  of RT 100% EtOH (363 microlitres), mix, and precipitate at RT or -70 C for 20 min. (or -20 C overnight).<br> 15.     Centrifuge at RT for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Pellet should appear  purple. Discard SN, add 100 microlitres of 70% EtOH (4C), mix gently by  tipping with finger, and spin for 5 min (same tube orientation!). Aspirate  most SN, spin 5 sec, and remove rest of liquid with pipette. <br> 16. Air dry for 5 min at RT. Make a master mix for all your reactions  (calculate some extra, e.g. for  reaction): ~30 microlitres/reaction of  hybridization buffer (5 x SSC, 6 x Denhardts 60 mM TrisHCl pH 7.6, 0.12%  sarkosyl, 48% formamide; filter sterilized) and 2 microlitres to each  reaction of tRNA from yeast, Sigma R8508) and 4 microlitres of DDW.  Add to each ss cDNA pellet and resuspend pellet with pipette.<br> 17. Place hybridization mixtures in 100 C temperature block for 5 min.  Let the tubes cool down at RT for 10 min. Spin the tubes for 15 sec to  remove evaporated liquid from lids. Gently vortex.	Hybridisation<br> <br> Numbers continue from Labelling procedure.<br> <br> 18.     Immediately before use, clean microarrays and coverslips with dust gun. Add hybridization mixture onto middle of inverted clean 60x25 mm LifterSlip. Slowly lower a labeled microarray with the DNA side onto the LifterSlip to prevent bubbles and misplacement.<br> 19.     Prepare Genetix chamber with one rectangule shape Whatman  filter paper, and add 1.5 ml of 15 x SSC to each filter. Put  microarrays into chamber and incubate at 49 C for ~16 hrs in hybridization oven.<br> 20.     Remove microarrays from humid chamber and immediately place into a  staining jar filled with wash solution 1 (2 x SSC, filter sterilized. Let  coverslip fall off by itself (~15 sec).<br> 22.     Put microarrays in slide rack. Wash in a staining jar with ~100 ml  of solution 1 at RT for 5 min with gentle shaking. <br> 22.     Transfer microarrays in slide rack to wash solution 2 (0.1 x SSC,  0.1% SDS, filter sterilized). Wash at RT for 15 min with gentle shaking as  before.<br> 23.     Repeat step 23.<br> 24.     Transfer microarrays in slide rack to wash solution 3 (0.1 x SSC,  filter sterilized). Wash at RT for 15 min with gentle shaking as before.<br> 25.     Exchange wash solution 3 once to get rid of all SDS.<br> 26.     Quickly transfer microarrays in slide rack to a centrifuge and  spin at 1200 rpm for 3 min to dry the slides (Make sure racks sit on clean filter paper over clean surface)<br> 27.     Store microarrays in light protected slide box at RT. Scan as soon as possible.	Slide scanning<br> <br> 1.      Turn power on scanner and restart the PC (so the PC can recognise  the scanner). Note that the lasers need 15 min to warm up before use.<br> 2.      Open GenePix Pro analysis program.<br> 3.      Open the sliding door of scanner and insert microarray into the  holding clamp (DNA side facing down!).<br> 4.      Open the Hardware Settings box and set the PMTs to 600, Laser  power to 100%, Focal position to 0, Pixel size to 10 micrometres, and  Lines to average to 2.<br> 5.      Start a low resolution scan by clicking the Preview Scan button;  this will display a low resolution image of your microarray.<br> 6.      Define area of interest using the Scan Area button and dragging  over the area with spots.<br> 7.      During low resolution scans adjust the PMTs in the Hardware  Settings box so that the two channels (Cy3 = 532nm = green channel, Cy5 =  635nm = red channel) are balanced. This is carried out by moving between  the Image tab and the Histogram tab at top of display. The image should  have only a few pixels *off the scale* (turning white), and the histogram  should show the two wavelengths having equal distribution. This may take  more than one low resolution but try and minimise the number of scans to  reduce photo bleaching of Cy dyes. <br> 8.      Once the image is balanced carry out a high resolution scan by  clicking the Data Scan button. This may take several minutes.<br> 9.      Save the complete data scan as two single image .tiff files (one  for each channel) by using the Open/Save function. We save the images  after the batch and slide number printed on the microarray label.
