Protocol Description	Cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin.	Chromatin was extracted as described by Nimblegens ChIP-chip protocol	DNA was extracted from cell lines and primary tumors using the DNAeasy kit from Qiagen	Chromatin was immunnoprecipitated  (as described by Li Z et al., PNAS, 2003)	Methylated DNA was immuno captured (as described by Weber et al., Nat Genet, 2005)	DNA labelled using Cy3 and Cy5 labelled random primers (as per Nimblegen DNA methylation analysis protocol v6.0)	Hybridization conditions were  performed as described in the Nimblegen  ChIP-chip analysis protocol v6.0	Scanning was performed using the Axon 4000B scanner and image data analysed using GenePix 6.0
