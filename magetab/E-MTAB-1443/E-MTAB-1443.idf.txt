Comment[Submitted Name]	Driver mutations, including NPM1c, activate a BRD4-dependent core transcriptional program in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Experiment Description	Recent evidence suggests that inhibition of BET epigenetic readers may have clinical utility in hematological malignancies. We demonstrate the efficacy of the BET inhibitor I-BET151 across a variety of AML subtypes, and demonstrate that a common core transcriptional program, which is HOX gene-independent, is downregulated in AML subtypes sensitive to I-BET treatment. Focusing on the most common mutation in AML, we present evidence to suggest that wildtype NPM1 has an inhibitory influence on BRD4, which is relieved upon NPM1c mutation and cytosplasmic dislocation. NPM1c mutation allows upregulation of the core transcriptional program facilitating leukemia development, and this program is abrogated by I-BET therapy.  Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of I-BET151 in human cell lines, a unique murine model and in primary patient samples of NPM1c AML. This submission only includes samples from the human cell line.

Protocol Description	OCIAML3 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 80% alpha-MEM + 20% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37C and 5% CO2. 	OCIAML3 cells were treated for 6 h with either I-BET151, leptomycin B (LMB) or DMSO (vehicle) alone. From these cells, chromatin was prepared and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-BRD4 antibody (ab75898, Abcam). Cells were crosslinked with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature; crosslinking was stopped by the addition of 0.125 M glycine. Cells were then lysed in 1% (w/v) SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors. Cells were sonicated in a Bioruptor (Diagenode) to achieve a mean DNA fragment size of 500 base pairs. An equal volume of Protein-A and Protein-G agarose beads, pre-absorbed with sonicated salmon-sperm DNA and BSA, were used to preclear the chromatin for 2 h before immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed for a minimum of 12 h at 4C in modified RIPA buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 90 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, EDTA-free protease inhibitors). An equal volume of Protein-A and Protein-G agarose beads, pre-absorbed with sonicated salmon-sperm DNA and BSA, were used to bind the antibody and associated chromatin. The beads were washed before elution of the antibody-bound chromatin. Reverse crosslinking of DNA was followed by DNA purification with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). 	Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified for sequencing using TaqMan PCR mastermix according to the manufacturers instructions. ChIP libraries used for massive parallel sequencing were prepared using the Illumina ChIP-seq kit with the following adjustments. Following chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA purification, 10-50ng of DNA was used to perform end repair of the ChIP DNA. The following reaction mix was used, DNA (10-50ng resuspended in 30 ml), DNase and RNase free ddH2O 10 ml, T4 DNA ligase buffer with 10 mM ATP 5 ml, 10 mM dNTP mix 2 ml, T4 DNA polymerase 1 ml, Klenow DNA polymerase 1 ml and T4 PNK 1 ml. The sample was incubated for 30 min at 20 C and then purified using the Zymo DNA Clean & Concentrator-5O kit with the DNA eluted in 11 ml of ddH2O. Following end repair adenine bases were added to the 30 end of the DNA fragments using DNA from above 11 ml, ddH2O 33 ml, Klenow buffer 5 ml, dATP 10 ml and Klenow (30 to 50 exonuclease deficient) 1 ml. The sample was incubated for 30 min at 37 C and the DNA was purified using the Zymo kit. Commercially supplied adapters (Illumina; the sequence is commercially protected) were then ligated to the DNA fragments using DNA ligase buffer 14 ml, adaptor oligonucleotide mix 2 ml, DNA ligase 4 ml and DNA 10 ml. The reaction was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and DNA purified using the Zymo kit. Following the ligation of adapters the DNA was amplified by PCR. The reaction conditions included DNA 10 ml, ddH2O 26 ml, 5X Phusion buffer 10 ml, 10 mM dNTP mix 1.5 ml, Phusion polymerase 0.5 ml and 1 ml of both forward and reverse PCR primers the sequence of which is commercially protected. The reaction conditions are as follows: 98 C, 30 s; 98 C, 10 s; 65 C, 30 s; 72 C, 30 s; back to 2 (18 cycles); 72 C for 5 min. Following PCR amplification, the DNA was purified using the MinElute PCR purification kit (QIAGEN). The clean DNA was then size fractionated in a 1.5% agarose gel. Each sample was run in isolation in the gel in a dedicated clean agarose tank in 1 X TAE buffer. The gel was subsequently stained with SybrGreen in a clean staining tank for 1 hr. Following this, 200 -400 bp fragments were excised from the DNA smear present on the gel, and purified using the MinElute QIAGEN Gel-Purification Kit. The completed library was then tested for both size selection and quantity of DNA using a 2100 Agilent Bioanalyser. 	The amplified DNA was used for cluster generation on the Illumina HiSeq following manufacturers instructions.	Illumina sequencing of ChIP material from OCIAML3 cells.	Sequenced reads were mapped to the reference human genome (hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) with default parameters.	OCIAML3 cells were grown for 6 hours at 37 degrees C in the presence of DMSO or I-BET151 (500 nM).	RNA from OCIAML3 human leukemia cell lines was extracted after 6 hours of treatment with I-BET151 using the Qiagen RNAeasy mini kit following the manufacturers procedures.	Total RNA was extracted and labelled using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Ambion).	Labeled RNA extracts were hybridized to Illumina HT12 v4 BeadArrays using the Illumina Direct Hybridisation Assay.	Hybridised Illumina HT12 v4 arrays were scanned using an Illumina BeadArray Reader.	Probe-level data were normalized using standard Illumina BeadStudio normallization algorithms for gene expression data. Summarized probe data were processed using the lumi package in R, including normalisation using quantile normalisation. 	Comparisons between the DMSO-treated and BET-inhibitor-treated samples for both cell lines were performed using the R package limma. Genes with a false discovery rate below 5 % and a fold-change greater than 2 were considered significant. Fold change data were transformed to the log2 scale.
