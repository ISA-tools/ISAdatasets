Comment[Submitted Name]	Base resolution maps of mutations, 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and transcriptome of blood, tumour and margin samples from a glioblastoma multiforme patient
Experiment Description	Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive type of brain cancer. Little is known about the complex relationship between genomic and epigenomic as tumour progresses. We present the following base resolution whole genome maps of matched tumour/margin and blood samples from a glioblastoma multiforme patient:<br>* Single nucleotide variations (SNVs), copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variations (SVs) as revealed by DNA sequencing. </br> <br>* 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels obtained using (oxidative)bisulfite sequencing. </br> <br>* Transcript levels produced using RNA sequencing.</br> <br>For the three samples with very large bam raw data files ('Blood DNA-seq', 'Margin DNA-seq' and 'Tumour DNA-seq'), bai index files are available from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/files/E-MTAB-5171/E-MTAB-5171.additional.1.zip

Protocol Description	Brain tumour biopsies were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin wax from which 4-m-thick sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. The diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) was made by light microscopical examination of H&E-stained sections.	Supra-total resection of a right frontal intrinsic tumour with maximum diameter of the enhancing component of 19mm, surrounded by only minimal oedema. Surgical samples were taken from the enhancing tumour mass and corresponding non-enhancing margin using advanced surgical techniques. 	PCR-free ReBuilT libraries for bisulfite sequencing were generated following our previously published method (pubmed id: 27031619). For the generation of PCR-free libraries for oxBS, libraries were oxidised (TrueMethyl Kit from CEGX) prior to bisulfite treatment. In brief, 350 and 175 ng of sonicated DNA from tumour and margin respectively were end repaired and dA-tailed before ligation of customized adapter pair. After (oxidative)-bisulfite treatment, degraded fragments were recovered through primer extension before dA-tailing and second adapter ligation. The high-resolution aim of this project led to divide each sample in 3 parts in order to be able to perform sequencing. Parts were subsequently immobilized on streptavidin coated magnetic beads, washed with binding buffer, eluted with 50 mM NaOH at 60C for 15 minutes.	Libraries for each part of the tumour and margin samples were prepared using TruSeq RNA Access kit (Illumina), using an input of 40 and 20ng respectively.	Each tumour and margin sample was frozen to -80C immediately on collection. The frozen samples were then defrosted and a 50 mg portion taken for DNA/RNA extraction. The samples were homogenised and then divided for DNA and RNA extraction. DNA extraction of both tissues and blood was performed using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit, RNA extraction was performed using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit. Quantification was performed using the Qubit quantification assay. The tumour/normal pair used in this study was the sample judged most pure by comparison with blood DNA using whole genome sequencing.

Parts were subsequently immobilized on streptavidin coated magnetic beads, washed with binding buffer, eluted with 50 mM NaOH at 60C for 15 minutes.	BS and oxBS-seq libraries were sequenced in 3 parts on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, V4 chemistry, 2x101+7 index cycles. The RNA libraries were sequenced for 2 x 75 cycles on HiSeq 2500 in Rapid mode achieving an average coding coverage of 136X (F3) and 272x (M3).
