Investigation Title	Expression analysis of microRNA in P7 Aldh1l1-EGFP cells
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression analysis of microRNA in P7 Aldh1l1-EGFP cells
Experiment Description	Aldh1l1-EGFP cells were FACS and isolated from postnatal day 7 mouse forebrains.  Total RNAs were then isolated and analyzed for microRNA expression.
