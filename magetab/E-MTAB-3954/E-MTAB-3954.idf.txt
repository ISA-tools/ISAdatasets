Investigation Title	Transcriptional binding patterns involved in promoter-enhancer interactions.												
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptional binding patterns involved in promoter-enhancer interactions.
Experiment Description	This study was designed to be able to determine the interactions between promoter and enhancer elements in the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell line HPC-7. The next step was to investigate if specific transcription factors could be associated with looping events and to determine if there was co-operative binding involved.

Protocol Description	HPC-7 cells (Pinto do O et al., 1998) were grown in Stem Cell Factor.	As described in Wilson et al., Cell Stem Cell. 2010 Oct 8;7(4):532-44	Hi-C and CHi-C was performed as described previously (Schoenfelder et al., 2015).	Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq ChIP Sample Prep Kit and according to the manufactures instructions.	 Sequencing libraries were prepared according to the manufactures instructions. 	Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina platform (2G Genome Analyzer, HiSeq 2000 or HiSeq 2500).	Capture Hi-C libraries were paired-end sequenced	Reads aligned to mm10 using Bowtie than converted from SAM to BED format using BEDTools.	bedGraphs created using bedtools then converted to bigWigs using UCSC utilities.	In-house scripts used to count cut sites in windows of 75, sliding by 20bp bins, bedGraphs created using bedtools then converted to bigWigs using UCSC utilities.	Peaks called using MACS2, using IgG sample as a control.	Peaks called using F-Seq.	Capture HiC Analysis of Genomic Organisation (CHiCAGO) pipeline
