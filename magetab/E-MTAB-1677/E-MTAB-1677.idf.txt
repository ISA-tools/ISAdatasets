Protocol Description	Bacterial overnight cultures were diluted in BHI and bacteria were grown until OD = 1.	After washing in PBS, the bacterial pellets were resuspended in 400 ml solution A (1/2 Glucose 20% + 1/2 vol Tris 25mM pH 7.6 + EDTA 10mM) to which an additional 60 ml of 0.5M EDTA was added. RNAs were subsequently extracted using classical TRIzol/chloroform protocol as described previously (Toledo-Arana et al., 2009). 	Sample preparation for each chip was then processed following the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (P/N 702232 Rev. 2) as previously described (Toledo-Arana et al., 2009).	Tiling arrays were normalized using DNA reference normalization (Huber, Toedling, & Steinmetz, 2006) against a wild-type strain grown in BHI at 37 degrees generating log-transformed expression values. Median expression of tiling data was adjusted to zero.
