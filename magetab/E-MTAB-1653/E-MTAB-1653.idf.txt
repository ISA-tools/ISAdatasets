Comment[Submitted Name]	Human Embryonic Stem Cells Polysomes
Experiment Description	H1s are induced to differentiate into the trophoblast (TE) lineage, and polysome analysis performed at 0hr (Undifferentiated), 12hr TE and 24hr TE. The whole cell extract (WCE) is a cytoplasmic lysate of the cell . G1-G4 represent RNAs that were found in different fractions of a sucrose gradient, which represents monosomes, polysomes, etc. Thus the WCE is used as the denominator so that for a particular transcript, we can express G1, for example, as a fraction of the total RNA.
