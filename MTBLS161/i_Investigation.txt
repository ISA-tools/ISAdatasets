Study Title	"Metabolic profiling reveals anomalous energy metabolism and oxidative stress pathways in chronic fatigue syndrome patients"
Study Description	"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating long-term multisystem disorder with a central and inexplicably persistent fatigue symptom that is unable to be relieved by rest. Energy metabolism and oxidative stress have been recent focal points of ME/CFS research and in this study we were able to elucidate metabolic pathways that were indicative of their dysfunction. Blood and urine samples were collected from 34 females with ME/CFS (34.9 ± 1.8 SE years old) and 25 non-ME/CFS female participants (33.0 ± 1.6 SE years old). All samples underwent metabolic profiling via 1D 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantitated metabolites were assessed for significance. Blood glucose was elevated while blood lactate, urine pyruvate, and urine alanine were reduced indicating an inhibition of glycolysis that may potentially reduce the provision of adequate acetyl-CoA for the citric acid cycle. We propose that amino acids are being increasingly used to provide an adequate carbohydrate source for the citric acid cycle. We suggest that this is via glutamate forming 2-oxoglutarate through an enzyme that deaminates it and subsequently elevates blood aspartate. Dysfunctional energy metabolism appears to have impacted creatinine and its elevation in urine suggests that it may be used as an alternative for anaerobic ATP production within muscle. A decrease in blood hypoxanthine and an increase in urine allantoin further suggest the elevation of reactive oxygen species in ME/CFS patients. These findings bring new information to the research of energy metabolism, chronic immune activation and oxidative stress issues within ME/CFS."

Study Protocol Description	"Forty-six patients with Myalgic encephalomye litis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and twenty-six non-ME/CFS control subjects were recruited in total. Prior to statistical analysis we removed all males and any females that were above 60 years of age, which reduced the cohort to 34 females with ME/CFS (34.9 ± 1.8 SE years old) and 25 non-ME/CFS female participants (33.0 ± 1.6 SE years old). This was done to account for age and sex related variables across the cohort.
</p>
The ME/CFS group comprised patients that are currently symptomatic and diagnosed as having ME/CFS in accordance to the Canadian guidelines [1] and cared by one clinician. Diagnosis of ME/CFS was made on the nature of the clinical history, in association with the Canadian criteria, having excluded other illnesses. The same clinician also verified that subjects within the non-ME/CFS cohort were not suffering from ME/CFS or any other illness. All subjects were asked to list their current medications and oral supplements. None of the subjects were related to one another nor were they ever living together and none of the subjects were obese or nicotine dependent.

PMID:16935963</br>"	"Urine was collected upon rising by each subject and stored at 4 ºC and within 6 hours a blood sample was then taken by venipuncture into BD Vacutainer® blood collection tubes.  All blood samples were rested in a refrigerator for 30 min to allow blood to coagulate before the serum was separated from the clotted whole blood sample by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. Five 0.6 ml aliquots of serum from each subject were collected and stored at -80 ºC. All urine samples were syringe filtered (0.2 µm, 25 mm diameter) and each was dispensed into five 1 ml aliquots and stored at -80 ºC."	"All blood and urine samples were prepared for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using a liquid-liquid extraction technique [1].  All 72 blood samples were prepared simultaneously and all 72 urine samples were prepared simultaneously.  A 250 µl sample of each serum/urine sample was added to 250 µl ice-cold deuterated chloroform and 250 µl ice-cold deuterated methanol and mixed by vortexing before being left to sit on ice for 15 minutes.  Samples were then centrifuged (16,100 x g) at 4 ºC for 10 minutes to produce a biphasic mixture with a hydrophilic phase of water/deuterated methanol and lipophilic phase of deuterated chloroform. A 297 µl sample of the top hydrophilic layer was added to an equal volume of 200 mM sodium phosphate in deuterium oxide (pH 7) and 66 µl of deuterium oxide containing 5 mM DSS and 0.2% (w/v) sodium azide to make a total volume of 660 µl.  The sample was then mixed by vortex, centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and 550 µl of supernatant was transferred to a 7-inch 5-mm 507-grade NMR tube for NMR analysis.

The 90º pulse width was calibrated and the receiver gain optimized."	"Standard 1D 1H spectra were acquired using a 1D NOESY pulse sequence (RD-90º-t1-90º-tm-90º-acquire) with a Relaxation Delay (RD) of 1.2 seconds and a mixing time (tm) of 0.1 seconds.  Water suppression was achieved by presaturation of the water signal during relaxation delay and mixing time. Each spectrum was collected over 32K of data points and 128 scans with a spectral width of 10.014 ppm.  Before Fourier transformation, the free induction decay was zero-filled and multiplied by a 0.3 Hz exponential line broadening."	"Using the Chenomx 6.0 NMR Suite Professional software package; spectra were manually phased, baseline corrected and referenced to DSS with a chemical shift of 0 ppm."	"The compound libraries in the Chenomx software were used to identify and quantitate metabolites in the NMR 1D 1H spectra based on their characteristic chemical shifts using 0.5 mM DSS as an internal chemical shift reference.  Metabolite identities were confirmed using 2D TOCSY experiments with TOPSPIN 1.3 software. Twenty-nine metabolites per blood serum sample and thirty metabolites per urine sample were identified."
