Study Title	"Metabolic effects of an aspartate aminotransferase-inhibitor on two T-cell lines"
Study Description	"An emerging method to help elucidate the mode of action of experimental drugs is to use untargeted metabolomics of cell-systems. The interpretations of such screens are however complex and more examples with inhibitors of known targets are needed. Here two T-cell lines were treated with an inhibitor of aspartate aminotransferase and analyzed with untargeted GC-MS. The interpretation of the data was enhanced by the use of two different cell-lines and supports aspartate aminotransferase as a target. In addition, the data suggest an unexpected off-target effect on glutamate decarboxylase. The results exemplify the potency of metabolomics to provide insight into both mode of action and off-target effects of drug candidates."

Study Protocol Description	"Molt-16 or Jurkat E6.1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media + 10 % heat inactivated FBS + 50 U/ml Penicillin-streptomycin with 0.1% PBS (controls), or 0.1% 10 mM hydrazinosuccinic acid in PBS (treated samples). The cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 hr. The cells were then transferred to 15 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 400 g for 4 min at 4 °C. Working on ice, the supernatants were discarded and the cell pellets were resuspended in cold PBS and centrifuged at 400 g for 4 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were again discarded and the cell pellets were washed twice more with PBS in this manner before the pellets were stored at -80 °C.
"	"The cell pellets were thawed on ice and then transferred to Eppendorf tubes using 500 µl extraction mixture (methanol:water 9:1 containing internal standards). A tungsten bead was added to each tube and the samples were extracted using a vibration mill for 2 min at 30 Hz. The samples were stored for 30 min at 0 °C, the tungsten beads were then removed and the samples were centrifuged at 14000 rpm (18620 x g) for 10 min at 4 °C. 300 µl supernatant solutions from each sample were transferred to GC-vials and concentrated to complete dryness under reduced pressure at room temperature and then stored at -80 °C.</br></br>

Before GC-MS analysis the samples were derivatized. The samples were thawed and then concentrated under reduced pressure at room temperature for 20 min to remove any condensed moisture. Methoxamine solution in pyridine (30 μl of a 15 μg/μl) was added and the samples were dissolved by shaking for 10 min and then allowed to stand for 20 h at room temperature. Then 35 μl of a 6:1 mixture of MSTFA with 1% TMSCl and a solution of methyl stearate in heptane (100 ng / μl heptane) was then added and briefly vortexed and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h."	"GC-MS was performed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph at the Swedish Metabolomics Center, Umeå, Sweden, https://www.swedishmetabolomicscentre.se/. The derivatized samples, 1 μl, were auto-injected (splittless) at a temperature of 270 °C. 

For samples J1_1-6 a 30 m GC-column with an inner diameter of 0.25 mm was used. The purge delay time was 75 secs and the rate was 20 ml/min. Helium was used as carrier gas (1 ml/min). The GC oven temperature was 70 °C for 2 mins and then increased 20 °C/min to 320 °C, where it was held constant for 8 mins. The detector voltage was 1670 V.</br>
All other samples employed a 10 m GC-column with an inner diameter of 0.18 mm. The purge delay time was 60 secs and the rate was 20 ml/min. Helium was used as carrier gas (1 ml/min). The GC oven temperature was 70 °C for 2 mins and then increased 40 °C/min to 320 °C, where it was held constant for 2 mins. The detector voltage was 1920 V."	"Mass spec analysis was preformed with an Leco Pegasus HT TOF-MS. The ion source temperature was 200 °C and the ionization energy was 70 eV. Mass spectra were collected in the mass range 50 to 800 m/z.</br>
n-alkanes (C8-C40) were used as external retention index standards."	"The raw GC-MS data was aligned against the internal standards retention indexes and compared against an in-house spectral library of metabolites (Swedish Metabolomics Centre, Umeå, Sweden) using the in-house RDA software."	"The tentatively assigned metabolite data was curated using NIST MS search v2.0 and the annotated integrated data was normalized against the cell number and methyl stearate in each sample. "
