STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS381"
Study Title	"Prediction, detection, and validation of isotope peaks in mass spectrometry data (Supplemental data for manuscript)."
Study Description	"Mass spectrometry is a key analytical platform for metabolomics. The precise quantification and identification of small molecules is a prerequisite for elucidating the metabolism and the detection, validation, and evaluation of isotope clusters in LC-MS data is important for this task. Here, we present an approach for the improved detection of isotope clusters using chemical prior knowledge and the validation of detected isotope clusters depending on the substance mass using database statistics. We find remarkable improvements regarding the number of detected isotope clusters and are able to predict the correct molecular formula in the top three ranks in 92% of the cases. We make our methodology freely available as part of the Bioconductor packages xcms and CAMERA."

Study Protocol Description	"All solvents used for sample preparation and analyses were of LC/MS-grade quality (CHROMASOLV, Fluka). A list of standard compounds used for the recovery experiment including sum formulas, molar masses, PubChem IDs can be found in the Supplemental Information included in MTBLS381 as MTBLS381_si.csv."	"N/A"	"Chromatographic separations were performed on an Acquity UPLC system (Waters) equipped with a HSS T3 column (100 x 1.0mm, particle size 1.8 μm, Waters) applying the following binary gradient at a flowrate of 150 μl/min : 0-1 min, isocratic 95% A (water/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)), 5% B (acetonitrile/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)); 1-16 min, linear from 5 to 95% B; 16-18 min, isocratic 95% B; 18-20 min, isocratic 5% B. The injection volume was 2.7μl (full loop injection)."	"Eluted compounds were detected from m/z 100-1000 using a MicrOTOF-Q-II hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with an Apollo II electrospray ion source in positive and negative ion mode using following instrument settings: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 1.6 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 6 l/min, 190 °C; capillary, -5500 V (+4000 V); end plate offset, -500 V; funnel 1 RF, 200 Vpp; funnel 2 RF, 200 Vpp; in-source CID energy, 0 V; hexapole RF, 100 Vpp; quadrupole ion energy, 5 eV; collision gas, argon; collision energy, 10 eV; collision RF 200/400 Vpp (timing 50/50); transfer time, 70 µs; pre pulse storage, 5 µs; pulser frequency, 10 kHz; spectra rate, 3 Hz. Internal mass calibration of each analysis was performed by infusion of 20 µl 10 mM lithium formiate in isopropanol/water, 1/1 (v/v) at a gradient time of 18 min using a diverter valve."	"Raw data was converted to mzData with Bruker CompassXport version 1.3.3. Processing of raw data was performed with the XCMS package. For the feature detection we used the XCMS centWave algorithm with the following parameters: snthresh = 6, ppm = 30, peakwidth = (5,12), prefilter = (2,200). The feature alignment was performed with the standard group.density algorithm from XCMS with bw = 3 and mzwid = 0.015. Afterwards, each dataset was processed with CAMERA functions in the following order groupFWHM, findIsotopes, groupCorr, findAdducts using standard parameters."	"For the evaluation we used a mixture of 39 known compounds (short: MM39), covering a broad mass range between 161 and 822 Da and different physico-chemical properties (see Supplementary Information S3). The mixture was measured as pure solution and spiked in different concentrations (20,5,1,0.2 μM) into methanolic extracts of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, to simulate a realistically complex matrix."
