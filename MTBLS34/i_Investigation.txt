Study Identifier	"MTBLS34"
Study Title	"Lipid mediators of inflammation in BALF 3-13 days after infection with influenza."
Study Description	"In this study broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from mice infected with influenza A virus, PR8 (200 PFU) or X31 (200,000 PFU) was analyzed for lipidomic host response in comparison with the mock infected animals. Time Points: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 13 days post infection.)"

Study Protocol Description	"At specified time points mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation. Hole was clipped in trachea, and bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) taken (3 x 1 ml cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) total). 700 µl of sample was used. After SPE column the elute was in 1 ml of methanol. That was then dried down to completion and taken up in 100 µl buffer A (63% H20, 37% ACN, 0.02% Formic Acid). Sample was enriched with 10 ng of each internal standard prior to extraction (100 µl of 26 internal standards from 0.1 ng/µl concentration solution)."	"Briefly, 0.9 ml of BALF samples were supplemented with a mix consisting of 25 deuterated internal standards (Cayman Chemical) and lipid metabolites isolated by solid phase extraction on a Strata X column (Phenomenex)."	"Lipid mediators were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) essentially as described previously [1][2]. The extracted samples were evaporated, reconstituted in a small volume and the eicosanoids were separated by reverse phase LC using a Synergy C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA).

"Authentic standards were analyzed under identical conditions and eicosanoid quantitation was achieved by the stable isotope dilution method and comparison with 141 quantitation standards. Data analysis was performed using the MultiQuant 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems)."
