Study Title	"Comparative metabolomics and transcriptomics revealed multiple pathways associated with polymyxin killing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa"
Study Description	"Polymyxins are the last-line antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa however, resistance to polymyxins has been increasingly reported. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of polymyxin activity and resistance is crucial for preserving their clinical usefulness. This study employed comparative metabolomics and transcriptomics to investigate the responses of polymyxin-susceptible PAK (polymyxin B MIC 1 mg/l) and its polymyxin-resistant pmrB mutant PAKpmrB6 (MIC 16 mg/l) to polymyxin B (4, 8, and 128 mg/l) at 1, 4, and 24h. Our results revealed that polymyxin B at 4 mg/l induced different metabolic and transcriptomic responses between polymyxin-susceptible and -resistant P. aeruginosa. In PAK, polymyxin B significantly activated PmrAB and the mediated arn operon, leading to increased 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) synthesis and the addition to lipid A. On the contrary, polymyxin B did not increase lipid A modification in PAKpmrB6. Moreover, the syntheses of lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan were significantly decreased in PAK, but increased in PAKpmrB6 due to polymyxin B treatment. In addition, 4 mg/l polymyxin B significantly perturbed phospholipid and fatty acid levels and induced oxidative stress in PAK, but not in PAKpmrB6. Notably, the increased trehalose-6-phosphate levels indicate that polymyxin B potentially caused osmotic imbalance in both strains. Furthermore, 8 and 128 mg/l polymyxin B significantly elevated lipoamino acid levels and decreased phospholipid levels, but without dramatic changes in lipid A modification in both wildtype and mutant strains. Overall, this systems study is the first to elucidate the complex and dynamic interactions of multiple cellular pathways associated with polymyxin mode of action against P. aeruginosa."

Study Protocol Description	"Both treated and untreated samples were collected at 0, 1, 4, and 24 hr for metabolite extraction. Bacterial cultures (20 ml) were collected and immediately transferred into 50 ml ice-cold falcon tubes. Samples were then rapidly quenched in a dry ice/ethanol bath for ~30 sec to stop the metabolic processes, and normalized according to OD600 at 0.50 to ensure the bacterial cell counts were at ~108 CFU/ml. Cell pellets were then collected from 10 ml normalized culture after centrifugation at 3,220 X g at 4 °C for 10 min. "	"After washing twice with 2 ml ice-cold 0.9% NaCl, cell pellets were then resuspended in 500 ul chloroform/methanol/water (CMW, 1:3:1, v/v) containing 1 uM generic internal standards (CHAPS, CAPS, PIPES and TRIS). A 3 X freeze-thaw process was followed to lyse the cells and release cellular metabolites. The extracted samples were centrifuged at 3,220 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and 300 ul supernatant was collected, which was followed by a further centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain particle-free supernatants (200 ul) for LC-MS analysis."	"Both hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) were employed to ensure the detection of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites. Samples were analyzed on a Dionex U3000 high-performance liquid chromatography system (HPLC).</br>
Briefly, samples maintained at 4 °C were eluted through a ZIC-pHILIC column (5 µm, polymeric, 150 × 4.6 mm; SeQuant, Merck) by mobile phase A (20 mM ammonium carbonate) and B (acetonitrile). The gradient started with 80% B at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, and followed by a linear gradient to 50% B over 15 min. The Ascentis Express C8 column (5 cm X 2.1 mm, 2.7 µm, Sigma-Aldrich, 53831-U) was applied in the RPLC method. The samples were controlled at 4 °C and eluted by mobile phase A (40% of isopropanol and 60% of Milli-Q water with 8 mM ammonium formate and 2 mM formic acid) and mobile phase B (98% of isopropanol and 2% of Milli-Q water with 8 mM ammonium formate and 2 mM formic acid). The linear gradient started from 100% A to a final composition of 35% A and 65% B over 24 min at 0.2 ml/min. All samples were analyzed within a single LC-MS batch to avoid variations. The pooled quality control samples (QC), internal standards and total ion chromatograms were assessed to evaluate the chromatographic peaks, signal reproducibility and the stability of analytes. To assist the identification of metabolites, a mixture of ~600 metabolite standards was analyzed within the same batch. (Further information can be found in attached files; Standard List.csv) "	"The MS system was operated on a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) in both positive and negative electro-spray ionisation (ESI) mode with a resolution at 35,000 and a detection range of 85 to 1,275 m/z. "	"Metabolomics raw data were initially converted to mzXML files and split into both positive and negative polarity and followed by feature detection with XCMS; data from all samples were then combined and annotated using mzMatch."	"The mzMatch data were filtered, identified, quantified and visualised in IDEOM using default values (http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/ideom.php)."
