Investigation Title	"ABCC6 induces nucleotide release"
Investigation Description	"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a heritable disease characterized by progressive ectopic mineralization of the skin, arteries and eyes, for which no effective treatment exists. PXE is caused by inactivating mutations in the gene encoding ABCC6 (MRP6), an ATP-dependent efflux transporter that is mainly present in the liver. Abcc6-/- mice have been instrumental in demonstrating that PXE is a metabolic disease caused by the absence of an unknown factor X in the circulation that is normally secreted from hepatocytes by basolateral ABCC6. Why absence of X results in PXE is a mystery. We now show that medium from HEK293 cells overexpressing human ABCC6 (hABCC6) or rat ABCC6 (rABCC6) potently inhibits mineralization in vitro, whereas medium of HEK293 control cells does not. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that cells expressing ABCC6 excrete large amounts of nucleoside triphosphates. We found that nucleotide excretion is not directly mediated via ABCC6. Extracellularly, ectonucleotidases converted these nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside monophosphates and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor of mineralization that plays a pivotal role in several mineralization disorders similar to PXE. The in vivo relevance of our data was demonstrated in Abcc6-/- mice, which had plasma PPi levels that were less than approximately 40% of those found in wild-type mice. Our data provide the first insight into how ABCC6 affects PXE. We propose a model in which ABCC6 secretes factor X from the liver into the circulation, where it induces nucleoside triphosphate release. The PPi formed from these nucleotides prevents the ectopic mineralization observed in PXE patients."

Study Title	"LC-MS metabolic profiling of mouse plasma and cell culture medium in relation to ABCC6 expression"
Study Description	"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive ectopic mineralization of the skin, eyes and arteries, for which no effective treatment exists. PXE is caused by inactivating mutations in the gene encoding ABCC6 (MRP6), an ATP-dependent efflux transporter that is mainly present in the liver. Abcc6-/- mice have been instrumental in the demonstration that PXE is a metabolic disease caused by the absence of an unknown factor in the circulation, the presence of which depends on ABCC6 in the liver. Why absence of this factor results in PXE remained a mystery. We now show that medium from HEK293 cells overexpressing either human or rat ABCC6 potently inhibits mineralization in vitro, whereas medium of HEK293 control cells does not. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that cells expressing ABCC6 excrete large amounts of nucleoside triphosphates, even though ABCC6 itself did not transport nucleoside triphosphates. Extracellularly, ectonucleotidases hydrolyzed the excreted nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside monophosphates and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor of mineralization that plays a pivotal role in several mineralization disorders similar to PXE. The in vivo relevance of our data was demonstrated in Abcc6-/- mice, which had plasma PPi levels that were less than 40% of those found in wild-type mice. This study provides the first insight into how ABCC6 affects PXE. Our data indicate that the factor that normally prevents PXE is PPi, which is provided to the circulation in the form of nucleoside triphosphates via an as yet unidentified, but ABCC6-dependent mechanism."

Study Protocol Description	"Whole blood was collected in syringes containing 7.5 I.U. of heparin by cardiac puncture and kept on ice until separation of plasma and erythrocytes by centrifugation (10 min, 1,000 x g, 4 °C). The plasma layer was collected, depleted of platelets by filtration (20 min, 2,200 x g, 4 °C) through a Centrisart I 300,000 kD mass cutoff filter (Sartorius) and stored at -20 °C until further processing.
</p>
HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 units pen/strep per ml at 37 °C and 5% CO2 under humidifying conditions. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Corning Costar) in triplicate at a density of 7.5 x 10^5 cells per well and allowed to grow to confluence overnight. At this point, the medium was replaced with 2 ml fresh medium with or without 1 mM ARL67156 (Tocris) plus 0.5 mM AMP-PCP (Sigma). Samples of 200 µl were collected after 24 hr and frozen at -20 °C until further processing.
</p>
Abcc6−/− mice were generated as described previously [1], and back-crossed into a C57BL/6 background (52). WT Abcc6+/+ mice, het- erozygous Abcc6+/− mice, and Abcc6−/− mice were housed in constant-tem- perature rooms under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and received food and water ad libitum. All mouse handling and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for animal care and use.

PMID:21725681</br>"	"After thawing on ice, 100 µl of each plasma and medium sample was deproteinized by adding 300 µl ice-cold methanol followed by vortexing. Following centrifugation (10 min, 20,800 x g, 4 °C), the supernatant was evaporated to dryness in a speedvac at room temperature. The dried extracts were reconstituted in 50 µl mobile phase A (5 mM N,N-dimethylhexylamine (Sigma) in water:methanol 95:5 (v:v)), centrifuged (10 min, 20,800 x g, 4 °C) and transferred to autosampler vials."	"Liquid chromatography was performed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A volume of 5 µl was injected onto a ReprosilPur Basic C18 HPLC column (150 x 0.5 mm; 2.4 µm particles; Dr. Maisch GmbH) protected by a KrudKatcher Ultra in-line filter (Phenomenex) and maintained at 30 °C. Elution was performed using a gradient (0-22 min: 0-53% B; 22-25 min: 53%-100% B; 25-35: 100% B and 35-50: 0% B) of 5 mM N,N-dimethylhexylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) in water:methanol 95:5 (v:v) (mobile phase A) and 20:80 (v:v) (mobile phase B) adjusted to pH 7.0 with acetic acid, at a flow of 15 µl/min."	"Detection was performed with an LTQ-Orbitrap Discovery mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in negative ionization mode, scanning from m/z 250-1000 with a resolution of 30,000 full-width-half-maximum (FWHM). Electrospray ionization was performed with the capillary temperature set at 300 °C and the sheath, auxiliary and sweep gas flow set at 20, 10, and 1 arbitrary units (AU), respectively. Data acquisition was performed using Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific)."	"To detect differences between ABCC6-proficient and ABCC6-deficient conditions, we converted all chromatograms to mzXML format using Proteowizard [1] and analyzed them using XCMS Online [2].
