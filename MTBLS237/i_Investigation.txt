Study Title	"Metabonomics of human fecal extracts characterize ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and healthy individuals."
Study Description	"This study employs spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling of fecal extracts from healthy subjects and patients with active or inactive ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) to substantiate the potential use of spectroscopy as a non-invasive diagnostic tool and to characterize the fecal metabolome in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Stool samples from 113 individuals (UC 48, CD 44, controls 21) were analyzed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker 600 MHz, Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). Data were analyzed with principal component analysis and orthogonal-projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis using SIMCA-P plus 12 and MATLAB. Significant differences were found in the metabolic profiles making it possible to differentiate between active IBD and controls and between UC and CD. The metabolites holding differential power primarily belonged to a range of amino acids, microbiota-related short chain fatty acids, and lactate suggestive of an inflammation-driven malabsorption and dysbiosis of the normal bacterial ecology. However, removal of patients with intestinal surgery and anti-TNF-alpha antibody treatment eliminated the discriminative power regarding UC versus CD. This study consequently demonstrates that 1H NMR spectroscopy of fecal extracts is a potential non-invasive diagnostic tool and able to characterize the inflammation-driven changes in the metabolic profiles related to malabsorption and dysbiosis. Intestinal surgery and medication are to be accounted for in future studies, as it seems to be factors of importance in the discriminative process."

Study Protocol Description	"All patients participated in this study in confirmation with the principals outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and with the approval of the Scientific Ethics Committee of the Copenhagen Capital Region (22 054/H-C-2009-037). Informed written consent was obtained from each participating person.
</p>
Patients were recruited at the Department of Gastroenterology, Medical Section, Herlev Hospital, Denmark. All eligible UC (n = 48) and CD (n = 44) patients subsequently had their diagnosis verified by well-established criteria (1) and were at the time of enrolment graded in accordance with the Mayo-score (2) (a score of 0–1 inactive UC, 2–4 mild UC, 5–8 moderate UC, and 9–12 severe UC) or Harvey-Bradshaw-score (3) (a HB-score score of 0–4 inactive CD, 5–8 mild CD, 9–16 moderate CD, and >16 severe CD).  
</p>
The healthy volunteers (n = 21) were recruited locally among the staff at Herlev Hospital—in all 113 individuals were included. Exclusion criteria were age above 80 or below 18 years, clinical evidence of infection, recent (within 14 days) use of antibiotics or probiotics, pregnancy, severe mental illness and special food regimens such as FODMAP, diabetic diets, and gluten-free diet. 
</p>
Each participant was given a sample collection kit with instructions. Hence, one fecal sample from each subject was collected, placed in a sealed insulate container, immediately put on ice, and subsequently delivered to the laboratory within 3 h, where it was stored at −80 °C.

"	"Fecal water was extracted by taking a weighed sample of thawed stool material and adding 2 volumes (w/v) of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS 1.9 mM Na2HPO4, 8.1 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The mixture was homogenized by vortexing vigorously for 1 min. The fecal slurry was centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 15 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a syringe with a needle (0.40 × 25 mm). The filtrate was centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 30 min, and the supernatant filtered through a Whatman 25 mm GD/X PES sterile syringe filter (pore size 0.2 µm). The filtered fecal water was stored at −80 °C until subsequent analysis."	"The fecal extracts were finally prepared by mixing 4 µl of D2O/500 µM TSP (3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuterosodium propionate, final TSP = 50 µM) with 40 µl of fecal extract in a 96-hole shallow hole plate. A total of 35 µl from each of these mixed samples were transferred into 1.7 mm outer diameter NMR tubes in a SampleJet rack used for the NMR experiments."	"All 1H NMR experiments were performed at 288.1 K, using a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz for proton and equipped with an inverse detection cryogenic probe (BrukerBioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany)."	"For all samples, the 1H NMR spectra were acquired using a CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) pulse sequence with an echo-time of 160 ms. The 90° pulse length was approximately 10 μs as calculated automatically for each sample. A total of 256 scans were collected into 32 k data points with a spectral width of 12 ppm."	"The free induction decays for one-dimensional data were zero-filled to 64 k data points and multiplied by an exponential function with a line-broadening factor of 0.5 Hz prior to Fourier transformation. All one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were manually corrected for phase and baseline distortions using TOPSPIN 2.1 (BrukerBiospin) and referenced to the TSP signal at δ 0.0 ppm. 1H NMR spectral regions δ 0.5–9.0 were binned with a width of 0.004 ppm (2 Hz) using the AMIX package (v3.9.3, BrukerBiospin).
</p>
The 1H NMR spectra were normalized to the total sum of the spectral integrals to compensate for sample concentration differences. Subsequently, the multivariate data analyses were carried out using the SIMCA-P + software package (v12.0, Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden). Initially, the principal component analysis (PCA) of the 1H NMR spectral data was performed (on mean-centered data) to visualize the general structure of each data set and to identify any abnormalities (based on the principles of Hotelling T2) within the data set. Next, the supervised multivariate methods, projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal-projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) [1] was applied to the analysis of 1H NMR spectral data scaled to unit variance (UV) in order to uncover metabolic differences. O-PLS is an extension of the partial least square regression method featuring an integrated orthogonal signal correction filter [2]. The interpretation of the model is facilitated by a back-scaled transformation of the loadings, with incorporated color-coded correlation coefficients (MATLAB v7.1, The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, USA) of the metabolites responsible for the differentiation as described by Cloarec et al [3]. In short, each back-scaled loading is plotted as a function of the respective chemical shift with a color code that indicates the weights of the discriminatory variables. A hot color (red) corresponds to the metabolite being markedly different between classes, while a cool color (blue) corresponds to no differences between classes.
</p>
In order to validate and avoid the risk of over-fitting the PLS model, a sevenfold cross-validation was used, i.e. iterative construction of models by repeatedly leaving out one-seventh of the samples, and predicting them back into the model. This procedure results in a cross-validation parameter Q2, indicating the predictability of the model in relation to its statistical validity. An additional cross-validation tool, a permutation test, was performed for each model: 200 models were constructed with the use of randomized classification for the samples and Q2 generated from these models were compared to the Q2 of the real model. If the maximum value of Qmax2 from the permutation test was smaller than the Q2 of the real model, the model was regarded as a predictable model. Similarly, the R2 was used to evaluate possibly over-fitted models. A final significance test was performed with the use of a CV-ANOVA (analysis of variance of the cross-validated residuals)  test to verify the models validity [4]. The models were only considered to be valid if the permutation test and the CV-ANOVA test were satisfied at the same time.
</p>
In order to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the established models receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) of true positive rates were plotted as a function of false positive rates in SPSS using cross-validated Y prediction values. The subsequent areas of under the ROC curves were also calculated in SPSS.

All UC patients were treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid; hence the resonances from 5-aminosalicylic acid and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, which include the entire aromatic region and δ 2.12–2.26, were removed whenever group comparisons involved UC patients. For the comparisons between CD and controls, two samples contained 5-aminosalicylic acid and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid and these samples were excluded from the analysis. The decision to exclude the two CD samples and thus keep the aromatic region in the remaining CD samples, as opposed to the UC samples, is based on the principle of keeping as many data as possible in order to generate valid results. The 1H NMR spectra were normalized to the total sum of the spectral integrals to compensate for sample concentration differences."
