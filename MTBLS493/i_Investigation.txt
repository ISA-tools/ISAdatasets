Study Title	"An LC–MS-based lipidomics pre-processing framework underpins rapid hypothesis generation towards CHO systems biotechnology"
Study Description	"INTRODUCTION: Given a raw LC–MS dataset, it is often required to rapidly generate initial hypotheses, in conjunction with other ‘omics’ datasets, without time-consuming lipid verifications. Furthermore, for meta-analysis of many datasets, it may be impractical to conduct exhaustive confirmatory analyses. In other cases, samples for validation may be difficult to obtain, replicate or maintain. Thus, it is critical that the computational identification of lipids is of appropriate accuracy, coverage, and unbiased by a researcher’s experience and prior knowledge. </br> OBJECTIVES: We aim to prescribe a systematic framework for lipid identifications, without usage of their characteristic retention-time by fully exploiting their underlying mass features. </br> RESULTS: Initially, a hybrid technique, for deducing both common and distinctive daughter ions, is used to infer parent lipids from deconvoluted spectra. This is followed by parent confirmation using basic knowledge of their preferred product ions. Using the framework, we could achieve an accuracy of ~ 80% by correctly identified 101 species from 18 classes in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The resulting inferences could explain the recombinant-producing capability of CHO-SH87 cells, compared to non-producing CHO-K1 cells. For comparison, a XCMS-based study of the same dataset, guided by a user’s ad-hoc knowledge, identified less than 60 species of 12 classes from thousands of possibilities. </br> CONCLUSION: We describe a systematic LC–MS-based framework that identifies lipids for rapid hypothesis generation."

Study Protocol Description	"Suspension-adapted CHO K1 cells were grown in protein-free media comprising of 50% HyQ PF-CHO (HyClone) and 50% CD CHO (Gibco-Invitrogen), supplemented with 1 g/l sodium bicarbonate, 6 mM L-glutamine and 0.05% Pluronic F-68 (Invitrogen). The stable recombinant SH-87 cell line expressing anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody was generated from CHO K1 and cultured in protein-free media comprising of 50% HyQ PF-CHO and 50% CD CHO, supplemented with 1 g/l sodium bicarbonate, 8 mM L-glutamine, 0.05% Pluronic F-68 and 600 μg/ml geneticin (G418, Sigma-Aldrich). All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 8% CO2 in single-use Erlenmeyer flasks (Corning, Acton, MA), subcultured every 3-4 days. Cells were harvested at exponential growth phase."	"1 x 10^7 cells were obtained at the mid-exponential phase (day 4) of replicate CHO-K1 and SH-87 cultures. The cells were quenched in 5 volumes of ice-cold 150 mM sodium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) solution and centrifuged for 3 min at 1250 x g and 4 ºC. The resulting solution was aspirated and 400 μl of ice-cold methanol (Fisher Scientific, optima grade) added to the cell pellet. The resuspended cells-methanol mixture was transferred to a 2 ml sample tube containing 200 μl of chloroform (Merck). Subsequently, 900 μl of cold methanol and 3.8 mM tricine (Sigma-Aldrich) (9:10) mixture, followed by 500 μl of chloroform was added to the sample tube. The mixture was vortexed for 30 to 60 s after the addition of each solution. The sample was then centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 20 min at 4 ºC. 800 μl aqueous methanol-tricine layer was transferred to a clean tube. A further 700 μl of cold methanol and 3.8 mM tricine (9:10) mixture was added to the chloroform phase, which was then centrifuged at 18,000 x g for another 10 min at 4 ºC. 1 ml of the aqueous layer was extracted and combined with the first aqeuous extract, while the chloroform layer was transferred to a clean glass vial. Both extracts were stored at -80 ºC. The non-polar chloroform extracts were dried and concentrated 2 times in an isopropanol-acetonitrile-methanol-water (5:2:2:1) mixture (all solvents from Fisher Scientific, optima grade) containing 0.1% acetic acid (Merck) and 0.1% ammonia solution (BDH)."	"The LC program for analyzing non-polar samples was as follows: the column was first equilibrated for 0.5 min at 1% B. The gradient was then increased from 1% B to 90% B over 9.5 min before a 0.3 min wash at 90% B and 1.7 min re-equilibration step to 1% B. The flow rate was set at 500 μl/min and a column temperature of 30 ºC was used. The eluent from the LC system was directed into the MS. The capillary and source voltages were 3 kV and 40 V respectively, for positive mode ionization, and 2 kV and 40 V, respectively, for negative mode ionisation. Source temperature was set at 120 ºC and dissolvation gas temperature at 600 ºC for both modes. The continuous infusion of leucine-enkephalin was used as internal lock mass."	"Electrospray ionization (ESI) was conducted in both positive and negative modes in full scan with a mass range of 50 to 1000 m/z. The capillary and source voltages were 1 kV and 30 V respectively, for positive mode ionization, and 0.9 kV and 30 V, respectively, for negative mode ionisation. Source temperature was set at 120 ºC and dissolvation gas temperature at 600 ºC for both modes"	"Raw data files were converted into mzXML format using vendor-specific MassLynx software (http://www.waters.com/waters/en_GB/MassLynx-Mass-Spectrometry-Software-/nav.htm?cid=513164&locale=en_GB)"	"No individual metabolites were identified in this study."
