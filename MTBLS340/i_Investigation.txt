Study Title	"NMR-based metabonomics and correlative analysis reveals potential bomarkers associated with chronic atrophic gastritis"
Study Description	"Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is one of the most important pre-cancerous states with a high prevalence. Exploring of the underlying mechanism and potential biomarkers is of significant importance for CAG. In the present work, 1H NMR-based metabonomics with correlative analysis was performed to analyze the metabolic features of CAG. 19 plasma metabolites and 18 urine metabolites were enrolled to construct the circulatory and excretory metabolome of CAG, which was in response to alterations of energy metabolism, inflammation, immune dysfunction, as well as oxidative stress. 7 plasma biomarkers and 7 urine biomarkers were screened to elucidate the pathogenesis of CAG based on the further correlation analysis with biochemical indexes. Finally, 3 plasma biomarkers (arginine, succinate and 3-hydroxybutyrate) and 2 urine biomarkers (a-ketoglutarate and valine) highlighted the potential to indicate risks of CAG in virtue of correlation with pepsin activity and ROC analysis. Here, our results paved a way for elucidating the underlying mechanisms in the development of CAG, and provided new avenues for the diagnosis of CAG and presented potential drug targets for treatment of CAG."

Study Protocol Description	"At the end of the experiment, rats were housed individually in metabolic cages for 24 h urinary collection (containing 0.05% sodium azide) after a 12 h fast."	"Whole urine samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The supernatant was carefully collected in fresh polypropylene tubes and stored at -80 °C for further analysis. After the last body weight determination, rats were anesthetized with 10% urethane.
</p>
Blood samples were collected, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The resultant plasma samples were stored at -80 °C until analysis. The gastric tissues were immediately removed and washed with physiological saline. One part of gastric tissues was cut and put into a tube containing 10% buffered formalin solution for the histopathology analysis."	"For plasma preparation, 300 μl of plasma and 300 μl of 0.9% NaCl (saline) in D2O (20%) were pipetted individually and mixed together. Following centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), 550 μl of supernatant was removed in a 5 mm NMR tube for NMR analysis.
</p>
For urine preparation, 500 μL of urine was mixed with 200 μl D2O and 200 μl phosphate buffer (0.2 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing D2O for the purpose of field lock and TSP as a chemical shift reference. The whole mixture was vortexed (30 s), and centrifuged at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Finally, 550 μl of sample supernatant was placed in a 5 mm NMR tube for NMR analysis."	"The one dimensional NMR spectra were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker 600-MHz AVANCE III NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) equipped with a Bruker 5 mm PA BBO probe operated at 600.13 MHz 1H frequency."	"Samples were analyzed using one-dimensional Carr-Purcell-Meibom-Gill (CPMG) NMR spectra (for plasma) and Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY, RD-90°-t1-90°-tm-90°-acquire) NMR spectra (for urine) with water suppression. These spectra were measured using a spin–echo loop time (2nt) of 35 ms to attenuate broad signals from lipids and proteins and only to assist observation of small metabolites. Each 1H NMR spectrum consisted of 64 scans requiring 5 min of acquisition time with the following parameters: spectral width: 12,335.5 Hz; spectral size: 65,536 points; pulse width: 30° (12.6 s); and relaxation delay (RD): 5.0 s. FIDs were Fourier-transformed with LB = 0.3 Hz."	"All NMR spectra were then corrected for phase and baseline distortions using MestReNova (version 8.0.1, Mestrelab Research, Santiago de Com-postella, Spain). The integral values of each spectrum were normalized to a total sum of the spectrum, decreasing any significant differences between samples.
</p>
The peaks of plasma spectra were referenced internally to the chemical shift of creatinine at δ 3.04 ppm. The plasma spectra were divided and the signal integral computed in 0.01 ppm intervals across the region δ 0.50-9.00 ppm. The region of δ 4.68-5.19 ppm was excluded from the analysis to eliminate the effects of imperfect water saturation. The data was then normalized to the total sum of the spectra prior to analysis.
</p>
For NMR spectra recorded in urine extracts, they were referenced to the chemical shift of TSP at δ 0.00 ppm. Using MestReNova, the regions 0.50-9.00 ppm of the urine spectra were reduced into integral bins of equal width (0.01 ppm). The spectral region between 4.68 to 5.05 ppm, corresponding to residual water, was removed to eliminate artifacts related to the residual water resonance."	"Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to process the acquired NMR data using SIMCA-P 13.0 (Umetric, Sweden). Import data was mean-centered and pare to-scaled prior to multivariate analyses. Partial least squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) was utilized to reveal the differences between different groups, which were necessary to eliminate outliers. Potential biomarkers were extracted from S-plots constructed with the followed OPLS-DA analysis, and the biomarkers were chosen based on their contribution to the variation. Metabolite peaks were interpreted with available biochemical databases, such as HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/)."
