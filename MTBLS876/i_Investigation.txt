Study Title	"Small intestinal microbial dysbiosis underlies symptoms associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders"
Study Description	"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been implicated in symptoms associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), though mechanisms remain poorly defined and treatment involves non-specific antibiotics. Here we show that SIBO based on duodenal aspirate culture reflects an overgrowth of anaerobes, does not correspond with patient symptoms, and may be a result of dietary preferences. Small intestinal microbial composition, on the other hand, is significantly altered in symptomatic patients and does not correspond with aspirate culture results. In a pilot interventional study we found that switching from a high fiber diet to a low fiber, high simple sugar diet triggered FGID-related symptoms and decreased small-intestinal microbial diversity and small-intestinal permeability. Our findings demonstrate that characterizing small intestinal microbiomes in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms may allow a more targeted antibacterial or a diet-based approach to treatment."

Study Protocol Description	"Eligible subjects were healthy adults (≥18 years) with baseline fiber intake ≥11 g/1000 calories/day; <10% daily calories from added sugar; ≥5 servings of fruits and vegetables/day; and ≤13% daily calories from saturated fat based on completed food frequency questionnaire. All participants consumed a 7-day standardized diet with typical United States macronutrient calorie distribution: 50% from carbohydrates, 35% from fats, and 15% from protein. The diet was low in fiber (<10 g/1000 calories/day) and high in simple sugar (≥50% of daily carbohydrates).  Dietary instructions and food choices were discussed at the index, pre-intervention visit by a licensed dietician.

Duodenal aspirates were obtained via a standard suction catheter passed through the suction port with minimal inflation in the stomach. At initial and follow up visits, participants completed a symptom and demographic questionnaire and provided a stool sample."	"No extraction was carried out in this study."	"Aspirate samples were centrifuged at 4 ˚C at 12,000 x g for 5 min. 162 µl of the supernatant was mixed with 18 µl of NMR buffer (1.5 M KH2PO4, 1g/l of TSP and 0.13g/l of NaN3, Sigma-Aldrich, pH 7.4) and transferred to a 3 mm NMR tube. Fecal samples were pre-weighed (~100 mg), randomised, and emptied into a screw-cap tube containing 50 mg of 1.0 mm Zirconia beads, to which 400 µl of ACN:H2O (1:3) was added. The tube was placed in a Biospec bead beater for 30 s. The homogenized sample was then centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 x g. The supernatant was carefully transferred into spin filter tubes and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 x g. 80 µl of the filtered fecal water was aliquoted into a 96-well plate, and 10 µl were used for quality control. Filtered fecal water in the 96-well plate was dried down under nitrogen flow before reconstituting with 540 µl of D2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and 60 µl of the NMR buffer. The reconstituted fecal water and buffer mixture was transferred to 5 mm NMR experiment tubes."	"Metabolic profiles were measured on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) set at a constant temperature of 300 K."	"A standard one-dimensional NOSEY experiment was performed for each aspirate and faecal water sample. A total of 64 scans were acquired per sample into 64 K data points for aspirates; 128 scans per sample were collected into 64 K data points for faecal water."	"The spectra data were imported into MATLAB (Version 8.3.0.532 R2014a, Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA, USA). A series of in-house developed scripts was used for the following executions. Phasing, baseline corrections and spectral calibration to TSP (0 ppm). The spectra were manually aligned. In order to account for the difference in sample concentration, probabilistic quotient normalization was applied to the samples. An in-house developed peak integration script was applied to extract area under the peak integral for assigned metabolite features."	"Metabolites were assigned using in-house libraries."
