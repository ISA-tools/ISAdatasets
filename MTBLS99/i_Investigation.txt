STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS99"
Study Title	"LCMS analysis of seven apple varieties with a leaking chromatographic column"
Study Description	"The experiment contains data from a metabolomics experiment on different apple varieties. Quality Control and Standard Mixture samples are also included. In this study, retention times are extremely variable because of a problem with the chromatographic column."

Study Protocol Description	"All samples included in the study were collected from the apple germoplasm collection of the Fondazione Edmund Mach (FEM) (Trento, Italy).
After the collection the samples were directly frozen and stored at -80 °C. For the sample homogenization, each apple was grinded and homogenised under liquid nitrogen with a IKA A11 homogeniser, and stored in 50 ml falcon flasks at -80 °C until the extraction."	"The protocol used for the extraction of the metabolites in whole apple was based on the method previously reported [1]. Briefly, 1 g of each sample powder was weighed into 15 ml amber vials and then 20 µl of the internal standard (IS), 1.2 ml of H2O:CH3OH (1:2) and 0.8 ml of CHCl3 were added. After vortexing for 1 min, the sample was put in an orbital shaker (Grant-Bio Rotator PTR-60) for 15 min at room temperature and then was centrifuged at 5000 x g and 4 °C for 10 min. The upper aqueous methanol phase was collected and filtered through 0.2 μm PTFE filters in 2 ml amber (LC-MS certificated) vials. The internal standard mixture was 4800 mg/l 4-OH-stilbene, 3000 mg/l gentisic acid, 1200 mg/l indol-proprionic acid in CH3OH/H2O (1/1 v/v).

DOI:10.1007/s11306-011-0298-z</br>"	"The chromatographic conditions were the ones described previously [1]. Analysis was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC controlled by MassLynx 4.1. For reversed phase (RP) an ACQUITY UPLC 1.8 µm, 2.1 x 100 mm HSS T3 column (Waters) at 30 °C was eluted with a gradient program starting from 100% A (water, 0.1 % formic acid) from 0 till 6 min and then increasing linearly over 56 min to 100% B (methanol, 0.1% formic acid) where it was held isocratic until 60 min, with a 0.3 ml/min flow rate. The injection volume was 5 µl and the samples were kept at 4 ºC throughout the analysis.

DOI:10.1007/s11306-011-0298-z</br>"	"The system used was a Waters Acquity UPLC coupled to a Synapt HDMS QTOF-MS (Waters, Manchester, UK) via an electrospray interface (ESI), operating in W-mode and controlled by MassLynx 4.1. Mass spectrometric data were collected in positive ESI mode over a mass range of 50 to 3000 amu with scan duration of 0.3 s in centroid mode. The transfer collision energy and trap collision energy were set at 6 V and 4 V. The source parameters were set as follows: capillary 3 kV for positive scan, sampling cone 25 V, extraction cone 3 V, source temperature 150 ºC, desolvation temperature 500 ºC, desolvation gas flow 1000 l/h and nebulizer gas 50 l/h. External calibration of the instrument was performed at the beginning of each batch of analysis by direct infusion of a sodium formate solution (10% formic acid/0.1 M NaOH/Acetonitrile at a ratio of 1/1/8), controlling the mass accuracy from 50 to 3000 m/z (less than 5 ppm) and mass resolution (over 14000 FWHM). LockMass calibration was applied using a solution of leucine enkephaline (0.5 mg/l, m/z 556.2771 for positive) at 0.1 ml/min."	"The UPLC-QTof MS raw data were converted to CDF format by the Waters Databridge tool of MassLynx."	"There was no identification of metabolites in this study."
