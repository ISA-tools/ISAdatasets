Study Identifier	"MTBLS364"
Study Title	"Multiplatform serum metabolic phenotyping combined with pathway mapping to identify biochemical differences in smokers"
Study Description	"A multiplatform comparison of serum of smokers (n=56) and non-smokers (n=57) using NMR spectroscopy and UPLC-MS was carried out to determine perturbed biochemical functions associated with tobacco smoking. This should be helpful for establishing causal relationships between exposure and adverse events. The statistical modelling revealed clustering of the classes, distinguished by metabolic biomarkers. The identified metabolites were subjected to metabolic pathway enrichment, modelling adverse biological events using available databases. Perturbation of metabolites involved in COPD, cardiovascular diseases and cancer were identified. Combining multiplatform metabolic phenotyping with knowledge-based mapping gives mechanistic insights into disease development which can be applied to next-generation tobacco/ nicotine products for risk assessment. </p> UPLC-MS protocols and data are reported in the current study MTBLS364.</br>NMR protocols and data associated to this study are reported in MTBLS374."

Study Protocol Description	"A period of 48 hr of clinical confinement with controlled diet preceded the biofluid sample collection with exclusion of caffeine, alcohol, grilled, fried, and smoked food. Adherence to these dietary restrictions was also required 48 hr before the visit to the clinic.
</p>
For this study, we only used serum samples collected at day 183 (n=55; 28 males, 27 females) for smokers and day 164 (n=57; 29 males, 28 females) for never-smokers who completed the study."	"Frozen serum samples (-80 °C) were thawed and then centrifuged at 2700 x g for 10 min to remove particulatesand precipitated proteins. Serum samples were prepared for metabolic profiling analysis by RP and HILIC UPLC–MS as follows: 200 μl of supernatant was treated (1:3) with isopropanol, incubated at -20 °C for 24 hr, centrifuged at 2700 x g for 20 min and aliquoted for HILIC and RP methods. QC samples were prepared by pooling 50 μl volumes of each sample. During the analysis, the samples were maintained at 4 °C in the autosampler and separated and analyzed using both RP and HILIC chromatographic methods."	"During the analysis, the samples were maintained at 4 °C in the autosampler and separated and analyzed using both reverse phase (RP) and HILIC chromatographic methods. RP and HILIC seperation were performed using a Waters Acquity Ultra Performance LC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Separation of lipid components by reverse phase was performed according to the Waters application publication[1]. HILIC separation was performed as previously described[2].

The serum samples were first subjected to analysis using UPLC-MS, with both positive and negative MS ionisation detection. Capillary and cone voltages were set at 1.5 kV and 30 V, respectively. The desolvation gas was set to 1000 l/hr at a temperature of 600 °C; the cone gas was set to 50 l/hr and the source temperature was set to 120 °C. For mass accuracy a lock-spray interface was used with leucine-enkephalin (556.27741/554.2615 amu) solution at a concentration of 2000 ng/ml and at a flow rate of 15 µl/min as the lock mass."	"All the raw spectrometric data for the four different data sets (RP UPLC-MS (ESI+), RP UPLC-MS (ESI-), HILIC UPLC-MS (ESI+) and HILIC UPLC-MS(ESI-) were processed using xcms in R. The centwave peak picking methods were used to detect chromatographic peaks and the data were normalized using probabilistic quotient normalization using the median spectrum as the reference."	"Multivariate principal component analysis was used to examine the data sets and to observe clustering in the results according to predefined classes. Univariate logistic regression was performed, adjusting for confounding factors between never-smokers and smokers with class variables (body mass index (BMI), gender, drug intake and age) for each MS feature in the data sets. Linear regression of the metabolic data was performed against urinary total nicotine equivalent (TNEQ) as the dependent variable."
