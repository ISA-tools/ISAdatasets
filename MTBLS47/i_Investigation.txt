Study Title	"Metabolomic Characterization of Knock-Out Mutants in Arabidopsis - Development of a Metabolite Profiling Database for Knock-Out Mutants in Arabidopsis (MeKO)."
Study Description	"Despite recent intensive research efforts in functional genomics, the functions of only a limited number of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes have been determined experimentally. Thus, improving gene annotation remains a major challenge in plant science. Because metabolite profiling can characterize the metabolomic phenotype of a genetic perturbation of plant metabolism, it provides clues to the function of genes of interest. In this regard, we chose 50 Arabidopsis mutants including a set of characterized and uncharacterized mutants, which resemble wild-type plants. We performed metabolite profiling of the plants using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To make the dataset available as an efficient public functional genomics tool for hypothesis generation, we developed the MeKO database, which allows evaluation of whether a mutation affects metabolism during normal growth. This database contains images of mutants, statistical data analyses, and data on differential metabolite accumulation. Non-processed data, including chromatograms, mass spectra, and experimental meta-data, follow the guidelines of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) and are freely downloadable. Proof-of-concept analysis suggests that the MeKO database is highly useful for gene annotation and for generation of hypotheses for genes of interest. MeKO is publicly available at http://prime.psc.riken.jp/meko/."

Study Protocol Description	"As described in [1], sterilized seeds were stratified at 5 °C for 2 d, and were successively sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 1% sucrose. Plants were cultivated in controlled growth chambers at 22 °C in 16-h light and 8-h dark conditions for 18 d. The aerial regions were harvested with 20 different biological replicates, 6 h after the onset of the bright phase. All plant materials were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen to quench enzymatic activity. Harvested samples with a fresh weight (FW) over 7 mg were used for GC-MS-based metabolite profiling. An equivalent of 55.6 µg of derivatized samples was injected.

"As described in [1], each sample was extracted with a concentration of 5 mg fresh weight of tissues per ml extraction medium (methanol/chloroform/water [3:1:1 v/v/v]) containing 10 stable isotope reference compounds using a Retsch mixer mill MM310 at a frequency of 30 Hz for 3 min at 4 °C. Each isotope was adjusted to a final concentration of 15 ng per µl injection. After centrifugation for 5 min at 15,100 x g, 100 µl of the supernatant was used for further analysis. The extracts were evaporated to dryness in a Savant SPD2010 SpeedVac Concentrator (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA).
</p>
Derivatization:</br>
For methoximation, 30 µl of methoxyamine hydrochloride (20 mg/ml in pyridine) was added to the sample. After 24 h of derivatization at room temperature, the sample was trimethylsilylated for 1 h using 30 µl of MSTFA with 1% TMCS at 37 °C with shaking. After silylation, 20 µl of n-heptane was added. All the derivatization steps were performed in the vacuum glove box VSC-100 (Sanplatec, Japan) filled with 99.9995% (G3 grade) of dry nitrogen.

"As described in [1], 1µl of each sample was injected in the splitless mode by an CTC CombiPAL autosampler (CTC analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland) into an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Wilmingston, USA) equipped with a 30 m x 0.25 mm inner diameter fused-silica capillary column with a chemically bound 0.25-µl film Rtx-5 Sil MS stationary phase (RESTEK, Bellefonte, USA) for metabolome analysis. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The temperature program for metabolome analysis started with a 2-min isothermal step at 80 °C and this was followed by temperature ramping at 30 °C to a final temperature of 320 °C, which was maintained for 3.5 min.

"The transfer line and the ion source temperatures were 250 and 200°C, respectively. Ions were generated with a 70-eV electron beam at an ionization current of 2.0 mA. Data acquisition was on a Pegasus IV TOF MS instrument (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) at an acquisition rate of 30 spectra/s in the mass range of a mass-to-charge ratio of m/z = 60-800. The solvent delay was 237 s.
</p>
Alkane standard mixtures (C8-C20 and C21-C40) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Tokyo, Japan) and used for calculating the retention index (RI). The normalized response for calculating the signal intensity of each metabolite from the mass-detector response was obtained with each selected ion current unique in each metabolite MS spectrum to normalize the peak response. For quality control, we injected methylstearate in every 6 samples. Quality control (QC) samples were prepared by mixing 100 µl of extracts of each wild-type sample. 6 QC samples per batch were run(30 samples in total)."	"Non-processed MS data from GC-TOF/MS analysis were exported in NetCDF format generated by chromatography processing and mass spectral deconvolution software, Leco ChromaTOF version 3.22 (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) to MATLAB 6.5 (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA), where all data-pretreatment procedures, such as smoothing, alignment, time-window setting, and peak deconvolution, were carried out by using hyphenated data analysis (HDA) [1][2].

PMID:16739992</br>"	"The resolved MS spectra were matched against reference mass spectra using the NIST mass spectral search program for the NIST/EPA/NIH mass spectral library (version 2.0) and our custom software for peak annotation written in JAVA. Peaks were identified or annotated based on their RIs and a reference mass spectra comparison to the Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) and our in-house spectral library. The metabolites were identified by comparison with the RIs from library databases (GMD and our own library) and with the mass spectra of authentic standards, and the metabolites were defined as annotated metabolites upon comparison with the mass spectra and RIs from these two libraries. The 5 batches of metabolite profiles were combined using the HDA method [1][2]. To correct the “batch effect” we applied COMBAT normalization [3] to our quality samples consisting of Col-0 wild-type plants for each batch. Data were normalized using the CCMN algorithm [4].
