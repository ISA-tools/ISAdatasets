Study Title	"A profile of the joint Toxoplasma-host infection metabolome finds broad changes to metabolism and discovers a novel parasite metabolic capability"
Study Description	"The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii is auxotrophic for several key metabolites and must scavenge these, and carbon sources like glucose. from the host. While the importance of metabolism to Toxoplasma infection it obvious, it is unclear how Toxoplasma infection actually changes metabolism. To address this question, we measured changes in the joint host-parasite metabolome over a time course of infection. Host and parasite transcriptomes were simultaneously generated to measure changes in expression of metabolic enzymes that might correlate with changes in metabolite abundance. Toxoplasma infection changed metabolite abundance in multiple pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, amino acid synthesis, and nucleotide metabolism. Our analysis indicated that changes in some pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, were mirrored by changes in parasite transcription, while changes in others, like the pentose phosphate pathway, were paired with changes in both the host and parasite transcriptomes. Further experiments led to the discovery of a Toxoplasma enzyme, sedoheptulose bisphosphatase, which funnels carbon into the pentose phosphate pathway through an energetically driven dephosphorylation reaction. This second route for ribose synthesis resolves a possible conflict between the Toxoplasma tricarboxylic acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway, which are both NADP+ dependent. During periods of high energetic and ribose need, the competition for NADP+ could result in lethal redox imbalances. Sedoheptulose bisphosphatase represents a novel step in Toxoplasma central carbon metabolism that allows Toxoplasma to satisfy its ribose demand without using NADP+. Sedoheptulose bisphosphatase is not present in humans, highlighting its potential as a drug target."

Study Protocol Description	"Low passage type II ME49 Toxoplasma gondii was used in all experiments. Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFFs) from the ATCC were grown in 60 mm dishes in DMEM with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Once HFFs were in deep quiescence, defined as 10 days post confluency, DMEM media was changed to metabolomic media, RPMI1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% FBS dialyzed against PBS (MW cutoff of 10 kD), 10mM HEPEs, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. After 35 hr, the media was again changed with metabolic media, 1 hr before infection with T. gondii."	"HFF dishes in triplicate were infected with 2 x 10^6 tachyzoites, or mock infected with an equal addition of media by volume. At time points 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hr post infection (HPI), dishes were washed 3x with ice cold PBS, then quenched with 80:20 HPLC grade Methanol:Water (Sigma-Aldrich). Dishes were incubated on dry ice in a −80 °C for 15 min. Plates were scraped, the solution removed and spun at 2500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and stored on ice, then the pellet was washed again in quenching solution and re-spun. Supernatants were combined, dried down under a N2 gas manifold, and stored at −80 °C."	"Samples were resuspended in 150 μl HPLC grade water (Fisher Optima) for analysis on a Thermo-Fisher Vanquish Horizon UHPLC joined to a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Orbitrap; Thermo Scientific). Chromatography was performed using a 100 mm x 2.1 mm x 1.7 μm BEH C18 Acquity column (Waters) at 30 °C. 15 μl of sample was injected via an autosampler at 4 °C and flow rate was 200 μl/min. Solvent A was 97:3 water/methanol with 9 mM Acetate and 10 mM tributylamine (TBA) with a pH of 8.2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Solvent B was 100% methanol with no TBA (Sigma-Aldrich). Products were eluted in 95% A/5% B for 2.5 min, then a gradient of 95% A/5% B to 5% A/95% B over 14.5 min, then held for an additional 2.5 min at 5% A/95% B. Finally the gradient was returned to 95% A/5% B over 0.5 min, and held for 5 min to re-equilibrate the column."	"Mass spectra were collected on a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Orbitrap; Thermo Scientific) by electrospray ionization (negative mode). Scan range was 75 to 1000 m/z."	"RAW files were converted to mzXML files using the MassMatrix file conversion tool. Data analysis was performed using the Metabolomics Analysis and Visualization Engine (MAVEN) software[1].
