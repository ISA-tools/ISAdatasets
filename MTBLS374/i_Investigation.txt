STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS374"
Study Title	"Multiplatform serum metabolic phenotyping combined with pathway mapping to identify biochemical differences in smokers"
Study Description	"A multiplatform comparison of serum of smokers (n=56) and non-smokers (n=57) using NMR spectroscopy and UPLC-MS was carried out to determine perturbed biochemical functions associated with tobacco smoking. This should be helpful for establishing causal relationships between exposure and adverse events. The statistical modelling revealed clustering of the classes, distinguished by metabolic biomarkers. The identified metabolites were subjected to metabolic pathway enrichment, modelling adverse biological events using available databases. Perturbation of metabolites involved in COPD, cardiovascular diseases and cancer were identified. Combining multiplatform metabolic phenotyping with knowledge-based mapping gives mechanistic insights into disease development which can be applied to next-generation tobacco/ nicotine products for risk assessment. </p> NMR protocols and data are reported in the current study MTBLS374.</br> UPLC-MS protocols and data associated to this study are reported in MTBLS364.</br>"

Study Protocol Description	"A period of 48 hr of clinical confinement with controlled diet preceded the biofluid sample collection with exclusion of caffeine, alcohol, grilled, fried, and smoked food. Adherence to these dietary restrictions was also required 48 hr before the visit to the clinic.
</p>
For this study, we only used serum samples collected at day 183 (n=55; 28 males, 27 females) for smokers and day 164 (n=57; 29 males, 28 females) for never-smokers who completed the study."	"Not applicable."	"Frozen serum samples (-80 °C) were thawed and then centrifuged at 2700 x g for 10 min to remove particulates and precipitated proteins. 300 μl of individual serum samples were prepared with pH 7.4 phosphate buffer for high resolution 1H-NMR spectroscopy as described previously[1].

Epub 2014 Sep 16."	"The serum samples were analysed using 1H-NMR spectroscopy 1H-NMR standard 1D (NOESYPR1D) with water pre-saturation and CPMG spectra were recorded on a 600 MHz Avance III Bruker NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) operating at 600.13 MHz performed to maximise metabolite coverage. All experiments were performed with 32 scans, a 10 ms mixing time, and 96,000 data points at a temperature of 310 K."	"The serum samples were analysed using 1H-NMR spectroscopy with two different pulse sequences. The first, the so-called noesy-presat sequence, provides an overview of all proton-containing species and yields sharp peaks for small molecule species, broad bands from the lipoproteins (used later for lipoprofile analysis, see below) and a broad largely featureless-background from proteins, the most abundant being albumin. The second pulse sequence, the so-called Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence, takes advantage of the different nuclear spin relaxation times between large and small molecules to attenuate the peaks from large molecules (those with shorter spin-spin relaxation times) to leave mainly small molecule metabolite peaks. The main data analysis was performed using the CPMG spectral data and the lipoprotein profiling was carried out using the noesy-presat spectral data.  For the CPMG spectra a relaxation delay (RD) of 4 s, a mixing time of 0.01 s, a spin-echo delay of 0.3 ms, 128 loops and a free induction decay (FID) acquisition time (ACQ) of 3.067 s were used. A total of 32 scans were recorded into 96k data points with a spectral width of 20 ppm."	"The acquired 1H-NMR spectra were zero-filled to 128 k points, Fourier transformed, phase and baseline corrected using Bruker Topspin 3.1 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). The serum spectra were referenced to the anomeric proton assigned to α-glucose at δ5.22 and imported to MATLABTM (R2014a, The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) for further analysis. Regions corresponding to the water peak (δ4.3 to 4.925) were removed. All spectra were normalized using probabilistic quotient normalization using the mean spectrum as the reference."	"Multivariate principal component analysis was used to examine the data sets and to observe clustering in the results according to predefined classes. Univariate logistic regression was performed, adjusting for confounding factors between never-smokers and smokers with class variables (body mass index (BMI), gender, drug intake and age) for each MS feature in the data sets. Linear regression of the metabolic data was performed against urinary total nicotine equivalent (TNEQ) as the dependent variable.
</p>
Confirmation of metabolite identities in the NMR data was obtained using 1D and 2D NMR experiments, spike-in of chemical standards, J-Resolved spectroscopy (JRES), TOtal Correlation SpectroscopY (TOCSY), and Hetero-nuclear 1H-13C Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy)."
