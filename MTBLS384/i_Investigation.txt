Study Title	"Serum-based metabolomics characterization of pigs treated with ractopamine"
Study Description	"A study was performed to determine if serum-metabolomics could be used to establish a predictive tool for identifying ractopamine misuse in pigs. Ractopamine, a beta-agonist used as growth promoter in livestock, is with great controversy, and it has been forbidden in most countries worldwide. However, due to economic benefits, the possibility of widespread abuse of ractopamine still exists. “Omics” strategies, based on the observation of physiological perturbations, are promising approaches to tackle drug misuse in breeding animals. In this context, our aim was to set up a high performance liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) based metabolomics workflow for screening pig serum for ractopamine administration. Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was developed to characterize and compare serum metabolic profiles from control and treated pigs. Two different extraction strategies were investigated, and the results showed that the combination of methanol extraction and methanol-water extraction protocols significantly improve the metabolites coverage. A two-level data analysis using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses was carried out to establish descriptive and predictive models, which enabled the discrimination of treated animals from control animals and highlighted a number of candidate biomarkers that contributed the most in the observed discrimination. This research indicates that metabolomics approach can be considered as a powerful strategy to highlight biomarkers related to ractopamine treatment in pig which may subsequently be implemented as screening strategy to predict for such illicit practices."

Study Protocol Description	"Ten 4 month-old female pigs (Axior Porc Charcutier) (Terrena, Ancenis, France) weighting 40 kg were randomly divided into control (n = 5 animals) and treated (n = 5 animals) groups. Animals were allowed a 3-day acclimatization period, following which, each animal received 1.8 kg feed/day. Pigs from the treatment group received then on a daily basis and during 29 days, a feed containing ractopamine hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich) (10 mg/kg feed). The 10 ppm daily dose was selected as corresponding to classical doses used in finishing pigs. Blood samples were collected at day 3, 9, 16, 18, 23, 29, for both control and treated animals. The blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature and the serum samples, obtained by centrifugation, were frozen and then stored at -80 °C. Prior to the extraction, serum samples were allowed to thaw on ice."	"In order to investigate and compare the global metabolomics profiles, two extraction strategies were used for sample preparation. 
</p>
Methanol extraction:</br>
This strategy is similar to the procedure published by[1]. 400 µl serum sample was extracted with 1400 µl MeOH containing 1 ng/µl of each labeled internal standard. Then the mixture was vortexed for 20 s before centrifugation (2000 r/min, 20 min, 4 °C). 370 µl supernatant was collected and then evaporated to dryness under gentle N2 at 30 °C, and subsequently reconstituted with 150 µl H2O before HPLC–HRMS analysis.
</p>
Methanol–water extraction:</br>
The extraction procedure firstly reported[2] and further re-adapted[3] was employed. The procedure consisted of a triphasic liquid–liquid extraction with MeOH:CHCl3:H2O (1:2:0.63). 190 µl of MeOH was added to 30 µl serum sample and the mixture was vortexed for 20 s. Following this, 380 µl of CHCl3 was added and vortexed for 20 s. Finally, 120 µl of H2O was added to induce phase separation. The sample was further shaken for 10 s and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 10 min before centrifugation (2000 r/min, 10 min, 4 °C). 150 µl the upper phase (MeOH+H2O) was then collected and evaporated to dryness under gentle N2 at 30 °C, and subsequently reconstituted with 30 µl H2O containing 2 ng/µl of each labeled internal standards before HPLC–HRMS analysis.
</p>
QC sample preparation:</br>
A pooled quality control (QC) sample was prepared by pooling aliquots of all individual study samples. In our study, QC sample was extracted and processed according to the procedures described the above sections respectively. Then, these two reconstitution solutions were combined and mixed thoroughly before HPLC–HRMS analysis. The QC solution is therefore representative of both extraction strategies tested. The same QC solution was injected at the beginning, the end, but also intervals of every 5 samples in each batch run to assure the analytical repeatability and the quality of the fingerprinting process throughout the study.

PMID:21774539</br>"	"An UltiMate® 3000 Series high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system coupled to a hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap (Q-Exactive™) mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a heated electrospray (H-ESI II) source was used for sample analysis. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a Hypersil Gold C18 column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.9 µm particle size, Thermo Fisher Scientific) together with the corresponding guard column maintained at 35 °C, without splitting to the electrospray interface. The mobile phase consisted in water containing 0.1% acetic acid (A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid (B). The used elution gradient (A:B, v/v) was as follows: 95:5 from 0 to 2.40 min; 75:25 at 4.50 min; 30:70 at 11 min; 0:100 at 14–16.5 min; 95:5 at 19–25 min. The injected volume was 5 µl and the flow rate was 400 µl/min."	"A hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap (Q-Exactive™) mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a heated electrospray (H-ESI II) source was operating in a polarity switching ion mode (positive/negative). High resolution MS fingerprints were acquired using the following parameters: spray voltage ±3 kV; capillary temperature 350 °C; sheath gas flow rate 55 a.u. (arbitrary units), auxiliary gas flow rate 10 a.u., spare gas flow rate 0; max spray current ±100 µA; probe heater temperature 300 °C; S-lens RF level 50. Full scan mass spectra were acquired from m/z 65 to 975 at a mass resolving power of 70,000 Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) at m/z 200. The scan speed was 2 Hz in profile mode. Daily instrument calibration was performed using a MSCAL6 ProteoMass LTQ/FT-Hybrid. Xcalibur 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) was used for data acquisition and analysis. In order not to bias statistical analyses or the metabolomics data structure, all the samples for analysis arising from control and treated animals, which were prepared separately by two extraction strategies, were randomized across the whole data acquisition sequence."	"HPLC–HESI (±) HRMS raw data files were initially preprocessed with Xcalibur 2.2. The raw (*.raw) files were subsequently converted to a more exchangeable format (*.mzXML) and polarity split using MSConvert[1]. Further data processing was performed using XCMS[2] software implemented with the R statistical language; multiple steps including: peak alignment, peak picking, retention time alignment followed by a peak grouping and integration step. The resulting XCMS matrix containing MS features for each sample, was subsequently exported to Excel® for univariate analysis, interbatch normalization and later to SIMCA-P+® (Version 13, Umetrics AB, Sweden) software for multivariate statistical analysis. The inter-batch instrumental drift may be confused with biological differences if it is not minimized. Therefore, after data processing, the removal of between-batch offsets and drifts was carried out by following the previously described procedure[3], assuming that the measurement errors in a single batch are randomly distributed, and that different batches can be compared and corrected using the average or median value of the QC samples in a batch.

Toronto, ON, Canada). The details contained in the database for each metabolite are, mainly: retention time, monoisotopic accurate mass and fragmentation pattern[1]. An in-house Excel® Macro file was used to improve the annotation of the metabolic fingerprints automatically. Then, metabolites of interest were searched against online databases, i.e. METLIN[2][3][4] and HMDB[5][6][7]. Metabolite hits were searched for using mass tolerance of ±5 ppm, molecular species, charge state and adduct types. Additionally, results generated after database searches were assessed in relation to metabolites physiochemical properties, spectral similarities, matrix of occurrence and reports in related publications.
