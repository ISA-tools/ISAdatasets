Study Title	"Correspondence of coral holobiont metabolome with symbiotic bacteria, archaea and Symbiodinium communities."
Study Description	"Microbial symbiotic partners, such as those associated with reef-building corals, mediate biochemical transformations that influence host performance and survival. While evidence suggests microbial community composition partly accounts for differences in coral physiology, how these symbionts affect metabolic pathways remains underexplored. We aimed to assess functional variation between coral-associated microbial partners in hospite. To this end, we characterized and compared microbial community composition and metabolomic profiles from 9 coral species. These data support and expand on previous research by demonstrating microbial communities and metabolite profiles are species-specific and are correlated to one another. Using Porites spp. as a case study, we present evidence that the relative abundance of different sub-clades of Symbiodinium and bacterial/archaeal families influence the composition of functionally important metabolites. Our data suggests that while some microbial partners benefit the union, others are more opportunistic and possibly parasitize the host. Consequently, coral partner choice likely influences cellular metabolic activities and, therefore, holobiont nutrition."

Study Protocol Description	"Coral fragments were collected using bone cutters, hammers and chisels from colonies (n=4-6) of 9 coral species representing 4 genera (Acropora, Montipora, Pocillopora and Porites) from a single fringing reef in Moorea, French Polynesia (S17°28’50.914”, W149°48’18.639”) in July of 2013. Coral fragments were immediately (< 1 min) immersed into liquid nitrogen to halt coral metabolism following collection."	"1 ml of 70% methanol was added for every 0.07 g of lyophilized coral tissue in order to capture a broad range of the metabolome. To enhance extraction efficiency, extracts were sonicated for 15 min and mixed using an orbital shaker for 24 h at 4 °C. The extract was transferred to a storage vial and stored overnight at -80 °C. To ensure samples were fully extracted, a second solvent volume (1 ml/0.07 g tissue) was added to the coral nubbin and mixed for another 24 h at 4 °C. The 2 extraction volumes for each sample were combined and centrifuged (4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C) to remove cellular debris and concentrated to dryness using a speed-vacuum."	"Extracts were reconstituted in 250 µl of deuterium oxide (D2O) containing 1 mM 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid sodium salt (TMSP-d4). The reconstituted sample was transferred to a 3 mm NMR tube."	"A 500 MHz Varian Unity Inova NMR spectrometer equipped with a 1H-broadband 3 mm probe measured metabolite profiles from coral extracts."	"A water suppression pulse sequence (PRESAT), consisting of 128 transients with a relaxation delay of 3 s over a spectral window of 5500 acquired each proton 1H spectrum."	"VNMRJ zero-filled Fourier induction decays to 64K and multiplied by 0.5 hz line widths prior to transformation. Spectra were manually phased, baselines adjusted using a Whittiker smoother, and profiles normalized to the total area using MestreNova (MesterLabs version 7.1.2). Following total area normalization, spectra were also normalized to sample extract weights to faciliate comparison."	"Dynamic adaptive binning identified 1H-NMR bins from the aligned NMR spectra between 0.5 and 10 ppm. The resulting metabolite data table was imported into R (version 3.1.1) and bin variables normalized to dry sample extract weights. Metabolites were identified by comparing proton signals to Chenomx 500 mHz database[1] and published NMR spectra from reef-building corals[2][3].
