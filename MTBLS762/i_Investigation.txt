Study Title	"Targeting the SREBP-dependent lipidomic reprogramming by virus infection for broad-spectrum therapeutic intervention"
Study Description	"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that exploit the host metabolic machineries to meet their extraordinary biosynthetic demands. Integrative transcriptomic and lipidomic profiling confirmed that Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection reprograms the host lipid metabolism. By exploring a bioactive lipid library, we identified a tool compound, AM580 which is highly potent in interrupting the life cycle of diverse viruses including MERS-CoV and influenza A virus.</br> Using click chemistry, the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) was identified as the primary cellular target of AM580 which accounts for its broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Mechanistic studies pinpoint multiple SREBP proteolytic processes and SREBP-regulated lipid biosynthesis pathways, including the downstream viral protein palmitoylation and double-membrane vesicles formation, that are indispensable for virus replication. Collectively, our study identifies a basic lipogenic transactivation event with broad relevance to human viral infections and represents SREBP as an ideal target for the development of broad-spectrum intervention strategies."

Study Protocol Description	"The MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012, a gift from Dr. Ron 12 Fouchier) were propagated in Vero-E6 cells. Cultured viruses were titrated by plaque forming unit (PFU) assays and/or 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay as we previously described with slight modifications [1]. Virus stocks were kept at −80 °C in aliquots.</br></br>  
Human lung adenocarcinoma (Calu-3) cells were obtained from ATCC (HTB-55) and confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination by Plasmo Test (InvivoGen). Calu-3 cells were mock infected or infected with MERS-CoV at 2 MOI and incubated in DMEM medium (FBS-free). At 24 hrs post infection, cells were collected for cellular lipid extraction. Inactivation of virus infectivity was confirmed before further processing as we previously described with some modifications.</br></br> 

The sample preparation was performed with minor modifications according to the Mplex method [2][3]. Briefly, medium was removed from infected cells at 24 hpi and the cells were immediately washed twice with ice-cooled quenching buffer consisted of 60% methanol and 0.85% ammonium bicarbonate in water. After quenching buffer removed, 500 μl of ice-cold 150mM ammonium bicarbonate solution was added to dissociate cells. The cells were then scraped and transferred into 15ml tubes (Nunc, Thermo Fisher, USA) on ice. An aliquot (50μl) of cell suspension was removed for DNA extraction (DNA mini-kit; QIAGEN, Germany) to perform cell count normalization.</br></br>

"Lipid extraction solution (2 ml) (-20 °C chloroform/methanol; 2:1, v/v) containing IS was added to the tubes of dissociated cells. A 100 μl aliquot of the mixed solution was removed for the confirmation of sterility by infectivity assay after lipid extraction. The remaining solution was centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the bottom phase was transferred to a glass vial and dried using a vacuum concentrator for storage at -80 °C. Inactivation of virus infectivity was confirmed before further processing as we previously described with some modifications [1].</br>
For analysis, the dried samples were reconstituted in 300 μl solvent mixture containing chloroform/methanol (v/v, 2:1). After centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, supernatants were transferred to LC vial for LC-MS analysis.</br></br>

The mobile phase consisted of (A) 0.1% acetic acid in water and (B) acetonitrile. The separation was performed at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min under a gradient program as follows: 0.5% B (0 to 1.5 min), 0.5 to 8% B (1.5 to 2 min), 8 to 35% B (2 to 7 min), 35 to 70% B (7 to 13 min), 70 to 99.5% B (13 to 29 min), 99.5% B (29 to 36 min). In order to achieve rapid equivalence, the flow rate was changed to 0.5 ml/min after 36 mins and the subsequent gradient program as follows: 99.5% B (36 to 36.1 min), 99.5 to 0.5% B (36.1 to 38.1 min), 0.5% B (38.1 to 40 min). The column and autosampler temperature were maintained at 45 °C and 10 °C, respectively. The injection volume was 8 µl.</br>"	"The mass spectral data were acquired in both positive and negative mode. The capillary voltage, sampling cone voltage and source offset were maintained at 2.5 kV, 60 V, and 60 V, respectively. Nitrogen was used as desolvation gas at a ﬂow rate of 800 l/h. The source and desolvation temperatures were maintained at 120 °C and 400 °C, respectively. Mass spectra were acquired over the m/z range of 50 to 1200. The SYNAPT G2-Si HDMS system was calibrated using sodium formate clusters and operated in sensitivity mode. Leucine enkephalin was used as a lock mass for all experiments. The MS data acquired mode is MSE for lipids profile and MS/MS acquisition was operated in the same parameter as in MS acquisition for lipids identification. Collision energy was used with the range from 20 to 40 eV for fragmentation to allow putative identiﬁcation and structural elucidation of the signiﬁcant lipids."	"Acquisition of the raw data was performed using MassLynx software version 4.1 (Waters Corp., MA, USA) and these raw data were firstly converted into the Analysis Base File (ABF) format. Then converted data were subsequently deconvolved into mass feature (MF) list using the MS-DIAL software (http://prime.psc.riken.jp/, version2.46). Processed data were then exported as a text file for further statistical analysis."	"The protocol of lipid identification was carried out according to published procedure [1][2]. The statistically signiﬁcant features were given annotation names by MS-DIAL once the MS features could match internal library criterion. MFs with significant abundance were selected for MS/MS experiment and analysis. All putative lipids were identified by using exact molecular weights, nitrogen rule, MS2 fragment and literature/database searches including METLIN database (http://metlin.scripps.edu/), Human Metabolome Database (http://www.hmdb.ca/), LipidMaps (http://www.lipidmaps.org/) and KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg). For final confirmation of lipids identity using authentic chemical standard, MS/MS fragmentation pattern of the chemical standard was compared with that of candidate lipids under the same LC-MS condition.</br></br>
