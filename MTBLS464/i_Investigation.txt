Study Title	"Untargeted Metabolomics To Ascertain Antibiotic Modes of Action"
Study Description	"Deciphering the mode of action (MOA) of new antibiotics discovered through phenotypic screening is of increasing importance. Metabolomics offers a potentially rapid and cost-effective means of identifying modes of action of drugs whose effects are mediated through changes in metabolism. Metabolomics techniques also collect data on off-target effects and drug modifications. Here, we present data from an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach to identify the modes of action of eight compounds: 1-[3-fluoro-4-(5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-pyrimidin-1-yl)phenyl]-3-[2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]urea (AZ1), 2-(cyclobutylmethoxy)-5'-deoxyadenosine, triclosan, fosmidomycin, CHIR-090, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), 5-chloro-2-(methylsulfonyl)-N-(1,3-thiazol-2-yl)-4-pyrimidinecarboxamide (AZ7), and ceftazidime. Data analysts were blind to the compound identities but managed to identify the target as thymidylate kinase for AZ1, isoprenoid biosynthesis for fosmidomycin, acyl-transferase for CHIR-090, and DNA metabolism for 2-(cyclobutylmethoxy)-5'-deoxyadenosine. Changes to cell wall metabolites were seen in ceftazidime treatments, although other changes, presumably relating to off-target effects, dominated spectral outputs in the untargeted approach. Drugs which do not work through metabolic pathways, such as the proton carrier CCCP, have no discernible impact on the metabolome. The untargeted metabolomics approach also revealed modifications to two compounds, namely, fosmidomycin and AZ7. An untreated control was also analyzed, and changes to the metabolome were seen over 4 h, highlighting the necessity for careful controls in these types of studies. Metabolomics is a useful tool in the analysis of drug modes of action and can complement other technologies already in use."

Study Protocol Description	"A 10-ml overnight culture of E. coli was inoculated into 40 ml of cation-adjusted MHB (no preincubation) or a 2-ml overnight culture of E. coli was inoculated into 48 ml of cation-adjusted MHB (with preincubation) and the mixture was incubated with shaking at 37°C. For assays without a preincubation step, the extractions were started at this point; for assays with a preincubation step, the cells were incubated for 2 h before extractions were started. Drugs were added at 4× MIC, and samples were taken at 0, 2, and 4 h after drug addition. Samples were cooled to 5°C in a dry-ice–ethanol bath to rapidly quench metabolism before they were transferred to ice. Ten milliliters of cells was pelleted at 3,000 relative centrifugal force (RCF), washed in 10 ml cold 0.85% NaCl, and then resuspended in 1 ml 0.85% NaCl. The OD590 of this cell suspension was taken and adjusted to 1. "	"For metabolite extractions, one milliliter of cells was pelleted and resuspended in 200 μl chloroform-methanol-water (1:3:1, by volume) (plus theophylline, 5-fluorouridine, N-methylglucamine, canavanine, and piperazine, all at 1 μM as internal standards). Samples were subjected to four freeze-thaw cycles in the dry-ice–ethanol bath with regular vortexing before a final centrifugation at 16,000 RCF. The supernatant was taken and kept at −80°C under argon. For lipid extractions, one milliliter of cells was pelleted and moved in a minimal volume of NaCl to a glass vial to which 400 μl 2:1 chloroform-methanol by volume was added using a glass pipette. Samples were shaken for 10 min at room temperature, and 125 μl NaCl was added. Samples were vortexed and then left at room temperature for 20 min. The bottom layer was removed and placed in a glass vial to be stored under argon gas at 4°C."	"A U3000 RSLC HPLC (Dionex) with a ZIC-HILIC or ZIC-pHILIC column (Sequant) was used to separate metabolite mixtures.  The HPLC mobile phase gradient for ZIC-HILIC was as follows: Solvent A is 0.1% formic acid in water, and solvent B is 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, 80% B (0 min), 50% B (12 min), 50% B (26 min), 20% B (28 min), 20% B (36 min), 80% B (37 min), 80% B (47 min).  Lipid analysis was done using a C30 column (3 μm, 3 by 150 mm) (Thermo Dionex). "	"Samples were analysed on an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) in both positive and negative modes (rapid switching) or a QExactive. An Orbitrap Velos was used for lipid analyses. Fragmentation of pHILIC column-separated metabolites was performed in a data-dependent manner on the Q Exactive (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer, with the five most intense ions picked in a 4 m/z exclusion window and at a collision energy of 65. Lipid analysis fragmentation was on the three most intense ions."	"Raw data were converted to mzXML using msconvert from Proteowizard. "	"Data analysis was performed using the MzMatch and IDEOM software packages for untargeted analysis. The Thermo Scientific Xcalibur software package was used for targeted peak picking and fragmentation analysis. Lipid analyses were conducted using LipidSearch software (Thermo Scientific)."
