Study Title	"Effects of Centella asiatica extract on antioxidant status and liver metabolome of rotenone-treated rats using GC-MS"
Study Description	"The standardized extract of Centella asiatica (ECa233) contains >80% triterpenoids with a ratio of madecassoside to asiaticoside of 1.5(±0.5):1. Hepatoprotective effect of ECa233 has not yet been reported. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of ECa233 on liver metabolome of rotenone-treated rats to better understand the underlying mechanisms of this bioactive substance in liver tissue. Rats were randomly divided into three groups (with six rats/group): sham negative control, rotenone positive control, and the ECa233 test group. Rats in the ECa233 group received 10 mg/kg ECa233 orally for 20 days, followed by 2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal rotenone injection to induce toxicity before being sacrificed. The liver samples were collected for antioxidant assays and untargeted metabolomic analysis using a GC-MS. Antioxidant tests revealed that ECa233 inhibited lipid peroxidation and increased catalase activities in liver tissue. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis clearly showed complete separation between control and rotenone groups, whereas the ECa233 group was located between these two groups and tended to reverse the effects of rotenone treatment. Two candidate markers were identified, pipecolinic acid and Unknown #21. Findings from this study suggested that supplementation of ECa233 protected rat liver against rotenone toxicity. However, further investigations are needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved."

Study Protocol Description	"Adult male Wistar rats weighing 300-350 g were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center, Mahidol University (Nakhon Prathom, Thailand). All rats were housed under the controlled conditions of 25 ± 2 °C with proper humidity and 12-hr dark/light cycles. Standard rat food and tap water were freely available in their home cage during the entire experimental process. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand (Approval No. 1533-004).
</p>
Rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (N = 18); control, rotenone and ECa233. On day 1 – 20, rats in control and rotenone groups received 1 ml/kg of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), while rats in the ECa233 group received 10 mg/kg ECa233 in 0.5% CMC orally. On day 15 – 20, 2.5 mg/kg rotenone in sunflower oil was intraperitoneally injected in rotenone and ECa233 groups whereas 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in sunflower oil was injected in the control animals. On day 21, all animals were euthanized under pentobarbital anaesthesia (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Liver samples were immediately removed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further measurements of metabolome and antioxidant capacities."	"Metabolomic analysis of rat liver samples were carried out using a previously published validated method[1]. 200 mg of fresh liver sample was homogenized (Glas-Col® homogenizer, Terre Haute, IN, USA) in 1 ml of 1 M sodium chloride. A 250 µl volume of acetone was immediately added into 100 µl liver homogenate to stop enzymatic activity. Then, samples were spiked with an internal standard (10 µl of 2 mg/ml of sodium deoxycholate), vigorously shaken for 1 min and incubated on ice for 5 min. Next, the mixtures were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min (Sorvall™ Legend™ micro 21R, Thermo Scientific™, Waltham, MA, USA). 200 µl of supernatant was then transferred to a GC vial and evaporated under nitrogen. A 50 µl of 15 mg/ml methoxyamine pyridine, followed by 90 µl of MSTFA with 1% TMCS, were used for derivatization at room temperature for 1 hr. Subsequently, 150 µl of n-heptane was added and filtered. Supernatant was used for further analysis.

The syringe was washed at least 3 times with acetone between the adding steps. The inlet temperature was set at 250 °C. The column temperature was initially set at 85 °C for 5 min. The temperature was increased to 205 °C at 8 °C/min and maintained for another 5 min. The temperature was increased again to 300 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min and held for 15 min."	"The Agilent 7000C GC/MS Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer transfer line was kept at 300 °C. The temperature of the ion source was 230 °C. The acquisition was performed in electron impact mode (70 eV) at the rate of 2 scan/s. Full-scan mass spectra were acquired from 33 to 650 m/z with a scan rate of 5 spectra/s."
