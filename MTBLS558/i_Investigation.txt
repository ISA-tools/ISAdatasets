Study Identifier	"MTBLS558"
Study Title	"Integration of magnetic resonance imaging and protein and metabolite CSF measurements to enable early diagnosis of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis"
Study Description	"Molecular networks in neurological diseases are complex. Despite this fact, contemporary biomarkers are in most cases interpreted in isolation, leading to a significant loss of information and power. We present an analytical approach to scrutinize and combine information from biomarkers originating from multiple sources with the aim of discovering a condensed set of biomarkers that in combination could distinguish the progressive degenerative phenotype of multiple sclerosis (SPMS) from the relapsing-remitting phenotype (RRMS). </br> METHODS: Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were integrated with data from protein and metabolite measurements of cerebrospinal fluid, and a method was developed to sift through all the variables to establish a small set of highly informative measurements. This prospective study included 16 SPMS patients, 30 RRMS patients and 10 controls. Protein concentrations were quantitated with multiplexed fluorescent bead-based immunoassays and ELISA. The metabolome was recorded using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Clinical follow-up data of the SPMS patients were used to assess disease progression and development of disability. </br> RESULTS: Eleven variables were in combination able to distinguish SPMS from RRMS patients with high confidence superior to any single measurement. The identified variables consisted of three MRI variables: the size of the spinal cord and the third ventricle and the total number of T1 hypointense lesions; six proteins: galectin-9, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), soluble CD40L (sCD40L) and platelet-derived growth factor AA (PDGF-AA); and two metabolites: 20β-dihydrocortisol (20β-DHF) and indolepyruvate. </br> The proteins myelin basic protein (MBP) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), as well as the metabolites 20β-DHF and 5,6-dihydroxyprostaglandin F1a (5,6-DH-PGF1), were identified as potential biomarkers of disability progression. </br> CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates, in a limited but well-defined and data-rich cohort, the importance and value of combining multiple biomarkers to aid diagnostics and track disease progression. </br>"

Study Protocol Description	"The lumbar puncture was performed through the L3/L4 or L4/L5 interspace, and CSF was collected in a polypropylene tube that was centrifuged for 5 min at 250 x g at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred, gently mixed and aliquoted in polypropylene tubes stored at -80 °C until analysis."	"CSF samples were thawed on ice, and 100 µl was transferred and mixed with 410 µl ice-cold methanol (MeOH) supplemented with an internal standard cocktail (D4-6keto-prostaglandin-F1-alpha, D4-thromboxane-B2, D4-prostaglandin-F2-alpha, D4-prostaglandin-E2, D4-prostaglandin-D2, D4-15-deoxy-delta12, 14-prostaglandin-J2, D4-cortisol and levonorgestrel) at a final concentration of 0.25 µM. The samples were further vortexed for 15 s and incubated at -20 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 20400 x g for 12 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes and dried using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator (overnight).
</p>
Upon analysis, the dried samples were reconstituted in 100 µl of 5% MeOH, 0.1% formic acid (FA) and 94.9% deionized MilliQ water. 10 µl of each sample was pooled to create a quality control (QC) sample to be injected repeatedly to monitor the performance throughout the analysis."	"The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were performed using a Thermo Ultimate 3000 HPLC and Thermo Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. 10 µl sample was injected to a Thermo Accucore aQ RP C18 column (100 x 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm particle size). The analytical gradient was initiated with an isocratic flow for 3 min (0% B), followed by a 2.6 min gradient (0-10% B), 8.3 min (10-100% B) and 3 min (100% B), followed, finally, by re-equilibration and washing of the column for 3 min (0% B), where A is 0.1% FA in MilliQ water and B is 89.9% acetonitrile, 10% isopropanol and 0.1% FA."	"Mass spectrometry data were acquired in profile mode (in positive and negative ionization mode) on a Thermo Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer, using a mass range of 70-900 m/z during the first 5 min and 148-900 m/z in the following 15 min (to avoid low mass contaminants) in the positive ionization mode and 70-900 m/z throughout in negative ionization mode. To improve the identification of metabolites, 8 tandem mass spectrometry analyses in positive and negative ionization mode were performed separately on pooled samples (RRMS, SPMS, control and global pools)."	"The acquired raw data was converted to an open source format (.mzML). Peaks were picked using msconvert from ProteoWizard[1] and preprocessed using the following pipeline within the OpenMS platform[2]. The peak-picked data were quantified by FeatureFinderMetabo[3], and the resulting features were linked across the samples using FeatureLinkerUnlabelledQT[4], allowing 10 s retention-time tolerance and 5 ppm mass deviation (this was performed irrespective of charge state across the samples). The non-default parameters can be found in Table S5 in the paper associated with this study.

PMID:23391308</br>"	"2 strategies were used for metabolite identification: 1) the experimentally measured peaks were compared to in silico fragmented spectra of the metabolites in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)[1], employing the Phenomenal infrastructure[2] and 2) the experimental MS2 spectra were manually curated and matched in mzcloud[3]. While mzcloud, in contrast to the de novo approach, has the advantage of matching against actual measured data on libraries of metabolites, it obviously lacks many metabolites that have not yet been measured and characterized, a weakness that is met by the de novo approach, where theoretical MS2 spectra for all metabolites in HMDB are present.
</p>
In cases when different identities were suggested by the 2 different approaches, the identity suggested by the de novo approach was chosen (implying that the identity was not present in mzcloud or that there was no clear match in mzcloud).
