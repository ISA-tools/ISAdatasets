Study Title	"Effects of MeJA on Arabidopsis metabolome under endogenous JA deficiency"
Study Description	"Jasmonates (JAs) play important roles in plant growth, development and defense. Comprehensive metabolomics profiling of plants under JA treatment provides insights into the interaction and regulation network of plant hormones. Here we applied high resolution mass spectrometry based metabolomics approach on Arabidopsis wild type and JA synthesis deficiency mutant opr3. The effects of exogenous MeJA treatment on the metabolites of opr3 were investigated. More than 10000 ion signals were detected and more than 2000 signals showed significant variation in different genotypes and treatment groups. Multivariate statistic analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) were performed and a differential compound library containing 174 metabolites with high resolution precursor ion-product ions pairs was obtained. Classification and pathway analysis of 109 identified compounds in this library showed that glucosinolates and tryptophan metabolism, amino acids and small peptides metabolism, lipid metabolism, especially fatty acyls metabolism, were impacted by endogenous JA deficiency and exogenous MeJA treatment. These results were further verified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of 21 related genes involved in the metabolism of glucosinolates, tryptophan and a-linolenic acid pathways. The results would greatly enhance our understanding of the biological functions of JA."

Study Protocol Description	"Arabidopsis thaliana wild type Wassileskija (Ws) and mutant opr3 were used in the experiment. The seeds were sown on 1/2 Murashige and Skoog medium after disinfection and vernalized. The seedlings were transferred to pots and cultivated in climate chamber (22 °C; 8 hr: 16 hr L: D, 65% r. h.).
</p>
The MeJA solution was sprayed on plant leaves after a vegetative growth period of approximately 28 days. The leaves were collected at different time points after treatment (0 hr, 1 hr, 4 hr and 8 hr), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to fine powder."	"For each sample, 100 mg plant leaf powder was weighted and transferred to a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. 750 µl water and 750 µl MeOH-ACN (1:1, v/v) was added, followed by sonication and centrifugation under the same condition. The supernatants were combined and 400 µl of the mixture was dried. The dried samples were redissolved in aliquots of 80 µL MeOH-H2O (1:1, v/v), filtered through a 0.1 µm membrane and transferred to sample vials for LC-MS analysis."	"UPLC separation was performed on a BEH C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 µm, Waters) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The gradient program using 0.1% FA in water (phase A) and 0.1% FA in ACN (phase B) was applied as follows: 95% A at 0 min to 55% A at 7 min, 5% A at 10 min and held for 4 min, then returned to initial condition."	"MS analysis was performed in the positive ion mode. The HESI source parameters were as follows: Spray voltage at 3.5 kV, Capillary temperature at 320 °C, Sheath gas flow rate at 30 l/h, Aux gas flow rate at 10 l/h, Sweep gas flow rate at 5 l/h, Heater temperature at 350 °C, S-lens RF level at 55. Full MS scan (m/z 70-1000) with resolution of 70 000 was used. 3 scans can be obtained per sec, which provides sufficient data points for quantification. MS2 scan used normalized collision energy of 35 V, an isolation window of 0.8 m/z and a mass resolution of 35 000."	"Peak alignment, background subtraction and component extraction of the raw data were achieved by SIEVE 2.1 software (Thermo Scientific). Component extraction was performed between retention time 0.5 and 16 min with intensity threshold at 500 000, minimum scan at 9 and signal to noise ratio at 10."	"Identification of differential compounds was achieved with the help of accurate mass measurement of molecular ions and fragment ions with high resolution. Accurate mass of molecular ions was searched against compound database (METLIN, KEGG, PlantCyc, AraCyc, HMDB, Lipid MAPS, MassBank, PubChem and MeSH) with mass accuracy at 5 ppm to generate a list of candidate chemical formulas. Isotopic pattern of the molecular ions helped to determine the probable formulas. MS/MS spectra database match search were used to match the fragment ion spectra to the candidate compounds. MS/MS spectra were also compared with theoretical fragmentation pattern with mass accuracy at 10 ppm using Progenesis QI 2.0 (Waters)."
