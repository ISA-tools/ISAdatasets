STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS356"
Study Title	"A serum nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomic signature of antiphospholipid syndrome."
Study Description	"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rheumatic inflammatory chronic autoimmune disease inducing hypercoagulable state associated with vascular thrombosis and pregnancy loss in women. Cardiac, cerebral and vascular strokes in these patients are responsible for reduction in life expectancy. Timely diagnosis and accurate monitoring of disease are decisive to improve the accuracy of therapy. In the present work, we present a NMR-based metabolomic study of blood sera of APS patients. Our data show that individuals suffering APS have a characteristic metabolomic profile with abnormalities associated to the metabolism of methyl group donors, ketone bodies and amino acids. We have identified for the first time the metabolomic fingerprint characterizing APS disease having potential application to improve APS timely diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic approaches."

Study Protocol Description	"Fifty-four (54) participants were selected from Clinical Pathology Laboratory of DEA III Liv. Nocera-Pagani, ASL Salerno from July 2014 to March 2015. One-half of the present patients (27/54; 50%, male/female: 10/17) had been previously diagnosed according to the revised diagnostic protocols[1], whereas the control group comprised healthy volunteers without major illnesses (27 subjects, male/female: 10/17). Inclusion criteria consisted of all APS patients and healthy individual who had voluntarily agreed to participate in this study, while exclusion criteria included persons who already had, or recently had, any medical conditions or with a recent history of drug addiction or alcohol abuse.
</p>
Sera samples were collected from male and female according to the standard operating procedure (SOP) for metabolomic-grade serum samples recently defined[2].

PMID:18007604</br>"	"Blood was collected into standard blood collection tubes and allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 to 120 min before centrifugation (1,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C). Serum was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C in Greiner cryogenic vials prior to NMR spectrometry measurements. Before being transferred to a 5 mm heavy-walled NMR-tube, samples were thawed at room temperature and thereafter spin at 3000 rpm using Vivaspin® 6 centrifugal concentrator to remove proteic and particulate matter. The serum supernatant was removed."	"To prepare NMR sample, 425 µl of each sera sample ware added to 25 µl of 1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 50 µl D2O. Trimethylsilyl propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid, sodium salt (TSP 0.1% in D2O) was used as an internal reference for alignment and quantification of the NMR signals; the mixture, homogenized by vortexing for 30 s, was transferred to 5 mm NMR tube (Bruker NMR tubes) before the analysis started[1].

TOPSPIN, version 2.1 or 3.0, was used for spectrometer control and data processing (Bruker Biospin)."	"1D NOESY experiments were acquired using spectral with of 14 ppm, 16k data points, excitation sculpting for water suppression, 192 transients, 4 s relaxation delay and 60 ms mixing time. The pulse sequence used included an excitation sculpting routine for the suppression of the water signal[1]. Due to the effect of excitation sculpting on the signal height of resonances in the region close to the water resonance,[2][3] the metabolites that have resonances close to this region (ascorbate, glucose, mannose and pyroglutamate) were quantified using resonances from those metabolites in other spectral regions. A weighted Fourier transform was applied to the time domain data with a 0.5 Hz line-broadening followed by manual phase and baseline correction in preparation for targeted profiling analysis.

"Quantification of serum metabolites was achieved using Chenomx NMR-Suite v8.0 (Chenomx Inc.). Briefly, the Chenomx profiler is linked to a database (http://www.hmdb.ca) containing more than 250 metabolite NMR spectral signatures encoded at different spectrometer 1H frequencies, including 600 MHz. Comparison of the spectral data obtained for each serum sample with the Chenomx metabolite library results in a list of compounds together with their respective concentrations based on the known concentration of the added internal reference compound, TSP. Each spectrum was analyzed 3 times by 3 different operators. The concentration of the single metabolites, reported as average values with the relative standard deviations, is reported in table S1 in the paper associated with this study."
