Study Title	"A Multi-Omic View of Host-Pathogen-Commensal Interplay in Salmonella-Mediated Intestinal Infection"
Study Description	"The potential for commensal microorganisms indigenous to a host (the microbiome or microbiota) to alter infection outcome by influencing host-pathogen interplay is largely unknown. We used a multi-omics systems approach, incorporating proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and metagenomics, to explore the molecular interplay between the murine host, the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), and commensal gut microorganisms during intestinal infection with S. Typhimurium. We find proteomic evidence that S. Typhimurium thrives within the infected 129/SvJ mouse gut without antibiotic pre-treatment, inducing inflammation and disrupting the intestinal microbiome (e.g., suppressing Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes while promoting growth of Salmonella and Enterococcus). Alteration of the host microbiome population structure was highly correlated with gut environmental changes, including the accumulation of metabolites normally consumed by commensal microbiota. Finally, the less characterized phase of S. Typhimurium's lifecycle was investigated, and both proteomic and glycomic evidence suggests S. Typhimurium may take advantage of increased fucose moieties to metabolize fucose while growing in the gut. The application of multiple omics measurements to Salmonella-induced intestinal inflammation provides insights into complex molecular strategies employed during pathogenesis between host, pathogen, and the microbiome."

Study Protocol Description	"6- to 8-week-old female 129/SvJ mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were used for oral infections. A final inoculum of 1.6 x 10^8 CFU S. Typhimurium/mouse was delivered by oral gavage to 10 mice (two cages of five mice each = Salmonella-infected). An equal number of mock-infected animals (two cages of five mice each = control) were administered an equal volume of sterile saline. Our infecting dose (10^8 CFU/mouse) aimed to establish a persistent infection that would ensure observation of S. Typhimurium proteins in downstream analyses. On the day prior to infection, and at seven time points post-infection, mice from one cage were transferred to a clean cage and fecal samples produced at that time were collected, pooled, and immediately frozen at 280 °C. Samples were collected on days -1, 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 21, and 28.
</p>
Frozen fecal samples were thawed on ice, and starting material weight was measured. Samples ranged from four to 25 fecal pellets per pooled sample. After thawing, 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer was added to the sample (between 1-2.5 ml based upon starting weight; volumes were recorded and used for downstream normalization), which was subsequently vortexed to disrupt fecal pellets. The resulting slurry was filtered through a 70 mm sieve to separate and remove large debris (mostly undigested food particles). Filtrate was centrifuged (900 x g for 10 min), and the protein-rich pellet thought to contain cellular material was retained as "P1." The supernatant was centrifuged to further clarify the sample (15,000 x g for 10 min). The pellet was retained as "P2" and the supernatant retained as "SN2." Preliminary analyses demonstrated that P2 samples contained prohibitively small protein yields; therefore, P2 samples were not investigated further. Proteomic and 16s rDNA sequencing analyses were performed using P1, and metabolite and glycan analyses were performed using SN2."	"SN2 samples were transferred to 0.6 ml microcentrifuge tubes, and water soluble metabolites were extracted with four volumes of chilled (-20 °C) chloroform: methanol mixture (2:1). After separating the two phases via centrifugation (12,000 x g, 5 min), the upper aqueous layers were transferred to glass vials and dried under a vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).
</p>
All extracted metabolites were subjected to chemical derivatization to enhance their stability and volatility during GC-MS analysis. Methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg/ml) was added to each dried sample, and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 90 min to protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric peaks. N-methyl-N- (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was then added, followed by incubation at 37 °C with shaking for 30 min to transform hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms. The samples were then allowed to cool to room temperature and were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC)-MS."	"The GC-MS system used in this study consisted of an Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GC separations were performed on a HP-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies). The injection mode was splitless and 1 ml of each sample was injected; the injection port temperature was held at 250 °C throughout the analysis. The GC oven was initially maintained at 60 °C for 1 min and then ramped to 325 °C by 10 °C/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325 °C."	"An Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used, and the samples were blocked and analyzed in random order for each experiment. Data were collected over the mass range 50-550 m/z. A mixture of FAMEs (C8-C28) was analyzed once per day together with the samples for retention index alignment purposes during subsequent data analysis."	"GC-MS raw data files from each Experiment were processed using the MetaboliteDetector software, version 2.0.6 beta. Briefly, Agilent.D files were converted to netCDF format using Agilent Chemstation, followed by conversion to binary files using Metabolite Detector. Retention indices of detected metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of the FAMEs mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all analyses after deconvolution."	"Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to an augmented version of FiehnLib (i.e., the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites), using a Metabolite Detector match probability threshold of 0.6 (combined retention index and spectral probability). All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to eliminate false identifications. The NIST 08 GC-MS library was also used to cross validate the spectral matching scores obtained using the Agilent library and to provide identifications of unmatched metabolites. Fragment ions due to trimethylsilylation (i.e. m/z 73 and 147) were excluded from the determination of metabolite abundance. A matrix of identified metabolites, unidentified metabolite features (characterized by mass spectra and retention indices and assigned as "unknown"), and their abundances was created for each Experiment for statistical analysis. Features resulting from GC column bleeding were removed from the data matrices prior to further data processing and analysis."
