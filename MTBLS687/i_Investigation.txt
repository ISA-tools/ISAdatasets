Study Title	"Linking root exudates to functional plant traits"
Study Description	"Primary and secondary metabolites exuded by plant roots have mainly been studied under laboratory conditions, while knowledge of root exudate patterns of plants growing in natural communities is very limited. Focusing on ten common European grassland plant species, we asked to which degree exuded metabolite compositions are specific to species or growth forms (forbs and grasses), depend on environments and local neighbourhoods, and reflect traditional plant functional traits. Root exudates were collected under field conditions and analysed using a non-targeted gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS) approach. In total, we annotated 153 compounds of which 36 were identified by structure and name as metabolites mainly derived from the primary metabolism. Here we show by using variance partitioning, that the composition of exuded polar metabolites was mostly explained by plot identity, followed by plant species identity while plant species composition of the local neighbourhood played no role. Total and root dry biomass explained the largest proportion of variance in exudate composition, with additional variance explained by traditional plant traits (DOI: 10.17871/TRY.18). Although the exudate composition was quite similar between the two growth forms, we found some metabolites that occurred only in one of the two growth forms. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of measuring polar exudates under non-sterile field conditions by mass spectrometry, which opens new avenues of research for functional plant ecology."

Study Protocol Description	"The phytometer species (five grasses and five forbs) were harvested in 46 of the 54 established plots (in total 304 individual plants) as follows. We dug a hole of ca. 20 cm depth and 15 cm length and width to extract one individual, carefully removed the rhizosphere soil and roots of other plants and gently washed the roots with tap water and dionised water. As the plants were only 3 months in the field by the time of harvest, the roots did not grow into other patches and could be easily extracted from the soil and surrounding plants. Therefore, it was possible to extract the phytometer plants completely without damaging their roots. The experimental setup protocol can be seen in Herz et al. 2017 [1].</br></br>

"	"We adapted a procedure developed by Aulakh et al. 2001 [1]. The complete roots of the intact plants were placed in  brown plastic vessels (Nalgene) containing deionised water of HPLC quality and exdued for 2 hours. Water samples (water of HPLC quality) without exudation were used for process control (blanks) and treated exactly like the exudate samples.  All samples were frozen and stored at -20 °C until further processing. After slowly thawing the sample solutions, each was filtered (Sartorius; 185 mm, 80 g/cm3) and  evaporated to driness under reduced pressure (30 mbar) at 40 °C by vacuum rotary evaporator. Metabolites were dissolving two times in 100 % methanol (Sigma-Aldrich), sonicating for 10 min at 20 °C The residuum was evaporated to dryness at 40 °C using a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted in 80% MeOH containing 20 µg/ml 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid  and 10 µM Ribitol as internal standards. Remaining particles were precipitated by centrifugation and an aliquot of 200 µl of each sample was centrifuged to precipitate remaining particles subjected to GC-MS.</br></br>

The metabolites were derivatized by methoxylamination with 50 µl methoxylamin-hydrochloride (20 mg/ml in pyridine, Sigma Aldrich) for 90 min at 37 °C and subsequently silylated with 50 µl BSTFA (Macherey–Nagel) with added alkane retention time indices (C12, C15, C19, C22, C28 (each 0.1 mg/ml final concentration; Sigma Aldrich) and C32 (0.4 mg/ml final concentration); Sigma Aldrich)) for 30 min at 37 °C [2].</br></br>

A 'chemical blank' (derivatization agents without biological sample) was interspersed every five to six samples to check for a potential carryover of metabolites during measurement.</br>

The measurements were performed using a gas chromatograph (6890N GC; Agilent Technologies) equipped with a ZB-5 Zebron GuardianTM Capillary GC column (30 m + 10 m ZebronTM, iD 0.25 mm, df 0.25 µm; Phenomenex). Samples (2 µl) were injected automatically by multipurpose sampler (MPS 2XL; Gerstel) at 230 °C injector temperature and separated chromatographically with 1ml/min flow and the following oven program: 1 min 70 °C, ramp with 7 °C per minute up to 300 °C, 5 min 300 °C. "	"A mass spectrometer (5975 MSD; Agilent Technologies) with settings and method adapted to Gorzolka et al. 2012 [1] was used for induction and detection of ion signals. Mass spectra in the range of 60 to 500 m/z were recorded with 20 Hz and a MS calibration obtained by daily automated tuning of the MS on PSTFA.</br></br>

In MeltDB, peak detection with SN = 5 and FWHM = 6 using the warped-algorithm and metabolite profiling with threshold = 0.75 for compound conformation was done [1].</br>
Compounds occurring in 50 % of water controls as well as in 50 % of chemical blanks were regarded as artefacts and excluded from the metabolite list. Classification of metabolites was done according to their affiliation to natural substance classes.</br></br>

Gaps in metabolite annotation were manually filled with the help of MeltDB, spectral and index libraries as well as Data Analysis (Agilent Technologies). Unidentified compounds were manually annotated by their mass to charge ratio (m/z) and retention time (RT). "
