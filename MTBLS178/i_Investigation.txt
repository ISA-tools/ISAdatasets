Study Protocol Description	"No information provided"	"Four volumes of solvent (methanol:ethanol, 1:1 v/v) were added to 100 µl of serum. After shaking for 15 min at 4 °C, the mixtures were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dried using a speed vacuum concentrator. The dried supernatants were dissolved in 10% methanol, and 5 µl of samples were injected into an Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography/quadrupole Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS)."	"UPLC separation was performed using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.7 µm, Waters). Samples were eluted by a linear acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% formic acid for 10 min at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min."	"Mass acquisition was performed on a Q-TOF-MS (Synapt HDMS system, Waters, USA) operating in both positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI–) electrospray ionization modes with the following parameters: capillary voltage of 2.8 kV for positive and 2.6 kV for negative modes; cone voltage of 40 V; source temperature of 110 °C; desolvation temperature of 300 °C; and desolvation gas flow of 500 l/h. The mass data were collected in the range of m/z 60-1200 with a scan time of 0.25 s and an interscan time of 0.02 s for 12 min. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a collision energy ramp from 20 to 50 eV in the mass range of m/z 60-1200 using automated data-dependent acquisition."	"Information on mass data including retention time, m/z, and ion intensities was extracted using MarkerLynx software (Waters, Milfold, MA, USA) with the following parameters: peak intensity threshold of 50 counts and automatic determination of deisotoping, peak width, peak baseline threshold, and noise elimination level. The alignment of mass peaks across all chromatograms was performed using the m/z range of 60-1200, mass tolerance of 0.05 Da, retention time window of 0.25 min, and mass window of 0.1 Da. The aligned and normalized data sets were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis of SIMCA-P ver. 12.0+ (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden)."	"For the identification of mass ions selected as potential markers, the following resources were used: 1) the molecular formula assigned by the element composition and isotope composition of precursor ions using MassLynx software; 2) the MS/MS spectra of standard compounds; and 3) metabolome databases including the Human Metabolomics Database (http://www.hmdb.ca/), METLIN (http://metlin.scripps.edu/), and LIPD MAPS (http://www.lipidmaps.org/).  In addition, major fragment ions in the MS/MS spectra of potential markers were compared with literary references on similar compounds.  Fragmented or adducted mass features from parent ions were revealed by comparison of their MS/MS spectra."
