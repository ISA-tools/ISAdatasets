Study Identifier	"MTBLS524"
Study Title	"Identification of a discriminative metabolomic fingerprint of potential clinical relevance in saliva of patients with periodontitis using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy."
Study Description	"Periodontitis is characterized by the loss of the supporting tissues of the teeth in an inflammatory-infectious context. The diagnosis relies on clinical and X-ray examination. Unfortunately, clinical signs of tissue destruction occur late in the disease progression. Therefore, it is mandatory to identify reliable biomarkers to facilitate a better and earlier management of this disease. To this end, saliva represents a promising fluid for identification of biomarkers as metabolomic fingerprints. The present study used high-resolution 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical analysis to identify the metabolic signature of active periodontitis. The metabolome of stimulated saliva of 26 patients with generalized periodontitis (18 chronic and 8 aggressive) was compared to that of 25 healthy controls. Principal Components Analysis (PCA), performed with clinical variables, indicated that the patient population was homogeneous, demonstrating a strong correlation between the clinical and the radiological variables used to assess the loss of periodontal tissues and criteria of active disease. Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structure (OPLS) analysis showed that patients with periodontitis can be discriminated from controls on the basis of metabolite concentrations in saliva with satisfactory explained variance (R2X = 0.81 and R2Y = 0.61) and predictability (Q2Y = 0.49, CV-AUROC = 0.94). Interestingly, this discrimination was irrespective of the type of generalized periodontitis, i.e. chronic or aggressive. Among the main discriminating metabolites were short chain fatty acids as butyrate, observed in higher concentrations, and lactate, gamma-amino-butyrate, methanol, and threonine observed in lower concentrations in periodontitis. The association of lactate, GABA, and butyrate to generate an aggregated variable reached the best positive predictive value for diagnosis of periodontitis. In conclusion, this pilot study showed that 1H-NMR spectroscopy analysis of saliva could differentiate patients with periodontitis from controls. Therefore, this simple, robust, non-invasive method, may offer a significant help for early diagnosis and follow-up of periodontitis."

Study Protocol Description	"26 patients (10 men and 16 women) with chronic and aggressive generalized periodontitis (18 and 8 respectively) were recruited from among the outpatients at the Department of Periodontology of Bretonneau Hospital in Paris, France (AP-HP, University Paris Descartes, Paris, France). The diagnostic criteria for chronic and aggressive generalized periodontitis were defined according to the classification proposed at the International Workshop for the Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions in 1999 [38]. Healthy controls (n = 26) were simultaneously recruited from dental students or medical staff and were matched by age (± 5 years), gender, and smoking habits. Both patient and control groups were balanced for ethnicity and socio-economic levels.
</p>
The collection of saliva was done under standardized conditions, between 09:00 and 11:00 am after paraffin wax-stimulation and to prevent blood contamination, before the assessment of clinical parameters. A volume of 10 ml saliva was collected (±5 min), the pH was recorded and the sample immediately stored at -25 °C. Patients and controls were required to refrain from eating, drinking, chewing gum, and tooth brushing for at least 2 h prior to the sample collection.

PMID:10863370</br>"	"No extraction was performed for this study."	"For NMR analysis, samples were thawed at room temperature and centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 x g before analysis. A volume of 0.6 ml of saliva was placed into a 5-mm-diameter specific tube together with 0.1 ml of D2O."	"The proton spectra were acquired at 500 MHz on a Varian Unity Inova® spectrometer at 25 °C."	"A signal was acquired after a 90° pulse of 32K data points on a spectral window of 5000 Hz. The relaxation delay was 4 s. The water signal was suppressed by a pre-saturation sequence using low-power irradiation (0.03 W for 2 s) on the water-signal frequency during the relaxation delay. The resulting free induction decays obtained with 128 transients were processed by NMR Pipe software."	"A Fourier transformation was applied with an exponential window function to produce a 1 Hz broadening line. Spectra were phased and a multipoint linear baseline correction was applied. Each spectrum was referenced using a propionic acid signal (1.04 ppm). The spectral region between 0–9 ppm was divided into 9000 spectral regions of 0.001 ppm width, called buckets, using in-house C code. The water region was excluded [5.1; 4.3 ppm]. The icoshift tool for Matlab (Matlab® 2014, The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was used for realignment[1]. Each bucket was integrated and scaled using probabilistic quotient normalization[2].
