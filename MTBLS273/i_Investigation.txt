Study Title	"Metabolic phenotyping of ex-vivo breast samples by DESI mass spectrometry imaging"
Study Description	"This study involves the analysis of surgically resected samples from patients undergoing breast surgery. The samples published here have been used as part of the publication by [1], and all experimental details can be found within. Desorption electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (DESI MSI) was used to provide spatially resolved metabolic profiles across the various tissue samples, which in combination with histological assessment allows characterisation of changes across distinct tissue types. In being able to characterise the metabolic differences between tissue types, it becomes possible to predict future unknown samples using a data-driven histological approach to enhance current disease prognoses. </p> Ref:</br> [1] Guenther S, Muirhead LJ, Speller AV, Golf O, Strittmatter N, Ramakrishnan R, Goldin RD, Jones E, Veselkov K, Nicholson J, Darzi A, Takats Z.

Study Protocol Description	"This was a single center, prospective observational study performed at Charing Cross Hospital (London, United Kingdom; REC 11/LO/0686). Tissue was sampled intraoperatively using a disposable core biopsy gun (Tru-Core II 14G x 10 cm). One biopsy sample was taken from each tumor and 4 to 5 biopsy samples were taken from the tumor bed; at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock and, from the posterior/deep cavity wall where possible."	"Frozen tissue sections (thickness, 15 µm) were prepared from each sample and subjected to DESI MSI."	"For DESI analysis, tissue sections were brought to room temperature. DESI MSI was carried out using a home-built DESI ion source coupled to a high-resolution orbital trapping mass spectrometer (Exactive, Thermo Scientifc GmbH). The DESI ion source was operated at a spatial resolution of 100 µm using nitrogen pressure of 4 bar, high voltage of 4.5 kV, a solvent mixture of methanol and water in a ratio 95:5 and a flow rate of 1.5 µl/min. The mass analysis was carried out in negative ion mode in the mass range m/z = 200–1,000 at a nominal mass resolution of 100,000 at m/z = 200 and a mass accuracy of ± 2 ppm."	"After DESI imaging, tissue sections were hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained and underwent histologic examination."	"All Thermo raw mass spectrometric data were converted to imzML format via imzML Converter (version 1.0.5) [1] and imported into MATLAB (R2013a) for preprocessing and analysis. Preprocessed data were subjected to multivariate statistical data analysis.
