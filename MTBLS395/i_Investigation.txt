STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS395"
Study Title	"Metabolomics by NMR identifies patients with high risk of death within two years after a cardiovascular event: The case of the AMI-Florence II study"
Study Description	"Risk stratification and management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is challenging and so this study aimed to evaluate the possible role of metabolomics in the prognostic stratification of ACS patients. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance was used to analyse serum samples from a cohort of 918 patients (345 females, 633 males, median age 74) with positive and negative (death) outcome within 2 years from the cardiovascular event. The obtained spectra were used to characterize the metabolic profiles of the two cohorts of patients. For the first time discrimination between patients with different outcomes after an ACS is demonstrated using metabolic profiling technologies, which seem to be more accurate than the standard stratification based on clinical and biohumoral parameters."

Study Protocol Description	"Blood serum samples were taken from 918 patients (345 females, 633 males, median age 74) enrolled in the AMI-Florence II study; among these 146 died (negative outcome), whereas 832 showed a positive outcome within 2 years from the cardiovascular event[1].

"	"1H-NMR spectra for all samples were acquired using a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) operating at 600.13 MHz with a 5 mm CPTCI 1H-13C/31P-2H cryo-probe including a z axis gradient coil, an automatic tuning-matching (ATM) and an automatic sample changer."	"One-dimensional (1-D) spectra of serum samples were acquired using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG; Bruker) spin-echo sequence to suppress signals arising from high molecular weight molecules.  "	"Free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential function equivalent to a 1.0 Hz line-broadening factor before applying Fourier transform. Transformed spectra were automatically corrected for phase and baseline distortions and calibrated (anomeric glucose peak at 5.24 ppm) using TopSpin (Version 3.8.4, Bruker). Each 1-D spectrum in the range between 0.02 and 10.00 ppm was segmented into 0.02-ppm chemical shift bins, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using AMIX software(Bruker BioSpin). Regions between 6.0 and 4.5 ppm containing residual water were removed."	"Assignment using AMIX, BBIOREFCODE (Bruker BioSpin) and available literature. The relative concentrations of each metabolite were calculated by fitting the signals in the spectra."
