Study Title	"Quantitative profiling of endocannabinoids in lipoproteins by LC–MS/MS"
Study Description	"Endocannabinoids belong to a diverse family of endogenous lipid bioregulators acting as physiological ligands of cannabinoid receptor type 1 and cannabinoid receptor type 2 in the central and peripheral nervous system. They are also present in nmol L−1 concentrations in human blood plasma; however, their association with possible molecular carriers remains poorly characterized. Here we report on the quantification of 46 endogenous molecular species from five major classes of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-related compounds in three lipoprotein fractions of human blood plasma: (VLDL), LDL, HDL, and in the plasma lipoproteinfree fraction. Although sizable quantities of endocannabinoid related molecules are associated with lipoproteins, we identified the lipoprotein-free fraction as a major carrier of endocannabinoids in blood circulation with the exception of 2-acylglycerols, which are markedly abundant in VLDL."

Study Protocol Description	"Samples of cubital venous blood were collected from five anonymous volunteers after overnight fasting, into 9 mL S-Monovettes (Nümbrecht, Germany) containing Na EDTA (1.6 mg mL−1), and centrifuged for 1 h at 3000g and 4 °C. Plasma was aliquoted into 1 mL vials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until analyzed.
"	"Endocannabinoids were extracted from the whole blood plasma and from lipoprotein (LPP) fractions in parallel at 4 ºC in a cold room. To 500 µL combined human plasma collected from five individuals, 50 µL of the internal standards mixture, 12.5 µL of 25 µmol L-1 fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor PF3845 (Cayman Chemical Company), and 750 µL ethyl acetate–n-hexane (9:1 (v/v)) containing 0.1 % formic acid were added. The internal-standard mixture comprised d4-N-acylethanolamine 16:0 at a concentration of 60 nmol L-1; d4-N-acylethanolamine 18:2 (191.5 nmol L-1); d8-N-acylethanolamine 20:4 (146.1 nmol L-1); d8-Nacylglycine 20:4 (400 nmol L-1); d8-2-acylglycerol 20:4 (360.2 nmol L-1 ) ; and d5-1-acylglycerol 20:4 (400 nmol L-1). After 30 s vortexing followed by 10 min centrifugation at 14,000g and 4 ºC, samples were incubated on dry ice for 10 min and, from each extract, the upper (organic) phase was collected and, in parallel, dried in a vacuum centrifuge for 25 min at the set temperature of 37 ºC. The dried extracts were reconstituted in 85 µL water–acetonitrile–iso-propanol–formic acid (6:3.6:0.4:0.1, (v/v)) mixture, centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000g, transferred into new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000g, and then 85 µL of the solution was transferred into a 300 µL glass vial for LC–MS/MS analysis."	"A C4 2 μL trap column (Optimize Technologies, Oregon City OR) in-line with a 0.5 mm × 150 mm C18 Zorbax analytical column (5 μm particles) (Agilent) with a flow of 20 μL min−1 and injection volume of 40 μL was used. The elution gradient was composed from solvent A: 0.1 % formic acid in water; solvent B: acetonitrile–isopropanol–formic acid (9:1:0.1 (v/v)). The gradient profile was: 0 min, 40 % B; 0–5 min, 40 % B; 5–7 min, 40–66.4 % B; 7–13 min, 66.4–73 % B; 13–15 min, 73–95 % B; 15–19 min, 95 % B; 19–20 min, 95–40 % B; 20–24 min; 40 % B (isocratic)."	"LC–MS/MS quantification of endogenous endocannabinoids was performed on an Agilent LC 1100 system (Amstelveen, The Netherlands) interfaced on-line to a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer TSQ Vantage (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose CA). Endocannabinoids were detected by MRM as [M+H]+ ions; S-lens voltages and collision energies were optimized individually for each standard compound in direct infusion mode. The transfer capillary temperature was 275 °C and the ion isolation width was 0.7 amu."	""	""
