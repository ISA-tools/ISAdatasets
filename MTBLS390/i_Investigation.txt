STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS390"
Study Title	"A metabolomic study of adipose tissue in mice with a disruption of the circadian system."
Study Description	"Adipose tissue functions in terms of energy homeostasis as a rheostat for blood triglyceride, regulating its concentration, in response to external stimuli. In addition it acts as a barometer to inform the central nervous system of energy levels which can vary dramatically between meals and according to energy demand. Here a metabolomic approach, combining both Mass Spectrometry and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, was used to analyse both white and brown adipose tissue in mice with adipocyte-specific deletion of Arntl (also known as Bmal1), a gene encoding a core molecular clock component. The results are consistent with a peripheral circadian clock playing a central role in metabolic regulation of both brown and white adipose tissue in rodents and show that Arntl induced global changes in both tissues which were distinct for the two types. In particular, anterior subcutaneous white adipose tissue (ASWAT) tissue was effected by a reduction in the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids, while brown adipose tissue (BAT) changes were associated with a reduction in chain length. In addition the aqueous fraction of metabolites in BAT were profoundly affected by Arntl disruption, consistent with the dynamic role of this tissue in maintaining body temperature across the day/night cycle and an upregulation in fatty acid oxidation and citric acid cycle activity to generate heat during the day when rats are inactive (increases in 3-hydroxybutyrate and glutamate), and increased synthesis and storage of lipids during the night when rats feed more (increased concentrations of glycerol, choline and glycerophosphocholine). </p> The data and protocols of GC-FID assay are reported in current study MTBLS390. </br> The data and protocols for UPLC-QTOF-MS assay are reported in study MTBLS380. </br> The data and protocols for NMR assay are reported in study MTBLS382."

Study Protocol Description	"A single loxP site and a Neo cassette flanked by an additional loxP site and 2 Frt sites were introduced into the introns upstream and downstream of coding exon 4 in mice bearing a conditional Arntlfx allele as previously described[1]. Mice were fed on a standard chow diet prior to the study. Mice were kept under an artificial light/dark, day/night, cycle: Lights were turned on at T0 and off at T12. Sampling at T0 and T18 therefore reflects metabolism during the night whilst T6 and T12 reflects metabolism during the day. Mice were euthanized under infrared light for tissue collection under circadian time. Adipose tissues (50-100 mg wet weight) were dissected under light and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Typically tissue was dissected within 1 min post mortem. All procedures were kept constant between controls and Arntl-/- mice. Studies were performed in accordance with the protocol approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mouse genotypes were assessed by PCR on genomic DNA from tail tips.

For each tissue sample 600 μl of methanol:chloroform (2:1 v/v) was added to 20 mg of frozen tissue. After being pulverised in a tissue lyser (Qiagen, UK) for 2 min at a frequency of 17/s, the sample was sonicated for 15 min. Following this, 200 μl of chloroform and 200 μl of waterwas added, then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. The separated aqueous and lipid phases were collected. The procedure was repeated twice. The organic fraction was left to dry in the fume hood under nitrogen gas overnight and the aqueous fraction was dried in an evacuated centrifuge.
</p>
50 μl of D-25 tridecanoic acid (200 μM in chloroform), 650 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) and 125 μl BF3/methanol (Sigma- Aldrich) was added to 100 μl of the lipid extract. The samples were then incubated at 80 ºC for 90 min. 500 μl of H2O and 1 ml of hexane were added, the organic layer separated and dried under a stream of nitrogen as described previously[2]. The sample was reconstituted in 200 μl of hexane and analyzed on a Focus GC followed by the introduction of the eluent into a FID (Thermo Electron Corporation, Hemel Hempstead, UK).

A TR-fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) stationary phase (GC) column (Thermo Electron; 30 m × 0.25 mm, ID × 0.25 μm; 70% cyanopropyl polysilphenylene-siloxane) was used with a split ratio of 50. The injector temperature was 230 °C and the helium carrier gas flow rate was 1.2 ml/min. The column temperature was 60 °C for 2 min, increased by 15 °C/min to 150 °C, and then increased at a rate of 4 °C/min to 230 °C. "	"Not applicable."
