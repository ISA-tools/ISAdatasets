Study Title	"Metabolomic Profiling of Mice Serum during Toxoplasmosis Progression Using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"
Study Description	"Better understanding of the molecular changes associated with disease is essential for identifying new routes to improved therapeutics and diagnostic tests. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamic changes in the metabolic profile of mouse sera during T. gondii infection. We carried out untargeted metabolomic analysis of sera collected from female BALB/c mice experimentally infected with the T. gondii Pru strain (Genotype II). Serum samples were collected at 7, 14 and 21 day post infection (DPI) from infected and control mice and were subjected to liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS)-based global metabolomics analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis identified 79 differentially expressed metabolites in ESI+ mode and 74 in ESI− mode in sera of T. gondii-infected mice compared to the control mice. Further principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) identified 19 dysregulated metabolites (5 in ESI+ mode and 14 in ESI− mode) related to the metabolism of amino acids and energy metabolism. The potential utility of these metabolites as diagnostic biomarkers was validated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. These findings provide putative metabolite biomarkers for future study and allow for hypothesis generation about the pathophysiology of toxoplasmosis."

Study Protocol Description	"6 to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 6 per group) were either left uninfected or inoculated orally with freshly prepared 10 cysts of Toxoplasma gondii type II Prugniuad (Pru) strain parasites by oral gavage. Mock-infected (control) mice underwent the identical infection protocol but with plain PBS without any parasite cysts. All the mice were checked daily for clinical signs of toxoplasmosis for 21 DPI (days post infection). Following anesthetizing animals, 6 mice from both infection group and control group were sacrificed at 7, 14 and 21 DPI, respectively."	"The blood samples from different infection groups (7d, n=6; 14d, n=6; 21d, n=6) and their corresponding control groups (n=6) were prepared as described previously [1]. Blood was collected by retro-orbital bleed into Eppendorf tubes directly and allowed to clot for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 3000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to collect the serum fraction. Supernatants were frozen immediately at -80 °C and shipped on dry ice. A total of 100 µl serum sample was thawed on ice at 4 °C and then precipitated by a solvent of acetonitrile-water (7:3), treated with ultrasonic waves for 15 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and then the supernatant was transferred to 1.5 ml polypropylene tube.

(LC-Q/TOF-MS) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The separation of all samples was performed on a C18 column (Agilent Technologies, Santa, Clara, CA) 100 Å (1.8 µm, 100 x 2.1 mm) with the column temperature maintained at 40 °C. The LC-MS system was run in a binary gradient solvent mode consisting of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) and the flow rate was 0.4 ml/min.

The mass scanning range was 50-1000 m/z. Nitrogen was used as the dry gas and cone gas. The mass spectrometry was operated in V optics mode and the data acquisition rate was set to 0.03 s, with interscan delay of 0.02 s. To ensure accuracy and reproducibility, LockSpray were used in all analyses and Leucine-enkephalin was selected as the lockmass for positive ([MH]+ = 556.2771) and negative ([MH]- = 554.2615) ion modes.
</p>
We used Quality control (QC) samples to assess the reproducibility and reliability of the LC-MS system. QC samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes (10 µl) from each serum sample as they were aliquoted for analysis. This “pooled” sample was used to provide a “mean” profile representing all the analytes encountered during the analysis. The pooled “QC” sample was injected five times at the beginning of the run to ensure system equilibrium and then every 6 samples to further monitor the stability of the analysis.

LC-MS raw data file was converted into common format, and then directly processed by the XCMS toolbox (http://metlin.scripps.edu/xcms/)[1]. Peak picking, peak grouping and retention time correction were all involved in data pre-treatment, which was done through the XCMS software that was implemented with the freely available R programming language (v 2.13.1). Retention time (RT)-m/z data pairs were used to identify ion intensities of those detected peaks. The consistent variables (ion intensity information) were obtained by filtering peaks with 80% missing values and those with isotope ions from each group.
</p>
In order to remove the offsets and adjust the importance of high and low abundance metabolites to an equal level, the data was pre-processed by both mean-centering and variance-scaling prior to multivariate analysis. Then, the resulting three-dimensional matrix, which includes assigned peak indices (retention time-m/z pairs), sample names and variables, was further subjected to multivariate data analysis.

A specific metabolite was sieved out when a match with a difference between observed and theoretical mass was less than 10 ppm. Then, the metabolite molecular formula of matched metabolites was further identified by the isotopic distribution measurement[1].
