Study Title	"Absorption efficiency of RESV through mouse skin using 3 bases in different tissues"
Study Description	"Resveratrol (RESV) is a plant polyphenol, which is thought to have beneficial metabolic effects in laboratory animals as well as in humans. Following oral administration, RESV is immediately catabolized, resulting in low bioavailability. This study compared RESV metabolites and their tissue distribution after oral uptake and skin absorption. Metabolomic analysis of various mouse tissues revealed that RESV can be absorbed and metabolized through skin. We detected sulfated and glucuronidated RESV metabolites, as well as dihydroresveratrol. These metabolites are thought to have lower pharmacological activity than RESV. Similar quantities of most RESV metabolites were observed 4 h after oral or skin administration, except that glucuronidated RESV metabolites were more abundant in skin after topical RESV application than after oral administration. This result is consistent with our finding of glucuronidated RESV metabolites in cultured skin cells. RESV applied to mouse ears significantly suppressed inflammation in the TPA inflammation model. The skin absorption route could be a complementary, potent way to achieve therapeutic effects with RESV. </p> One mg of RESV dissolved in ethanol was applied directly (Et) or mixed with hydrophilic ointment (HO), macrogol (Ma) or CMC gel (CMC), and swabbed on mouse dorsal skin. After 4 h mice were sacrificed, metabolites were extracted from tissues and analyzed by LC-MS. Peak areas of metabolites were normalized using peak areas of spiked internal standards (10 nmol 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and piperazine-N,N’-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES)."

Study Protocol Description	"Mice were anesthetized by pentobarbital and blood was collected from the right heart ventricle. Metabolome samples were prepared from blood (0.2 ml), liver and dorsal skin (around 100 mg of each tissue)."	"Around 100 mg of each mouse tissue was cut out and weighted. Tissues were minced and homogenized for 3 min in 500 µl 50% methanol on ice using BioMasher II (Nippi, Tokyo, Japan). Next, 1 ml 50% methanol and internal standards (10 nmol HEPES and PIPES) were added to the samples. HEPES and PIPES were used as internal standards to correct for the variation of sample preparation and different detection efficiency. After brief vortexing samples were centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered for further processing.
</p>
For metabolite extraction 0.2 ml of blood were mixed with 1.8 ml 55% methanol pre-chilled to -40 °C. Internal standards (HEPES and PIPES) were added and samples kept until further processing.
</p>
To remove proteins, metabolome samples were transferred to Amicon Ultra 10 kDa cut-off filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Following sample concentration by vacuum evaporation, each sample was resuspended in 40 µl 50% acetonitrile and 1 µl was used for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis."	"LC-MS data were obtained using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), as described previously [1]. Briefly, metabolites were separated on a ZIC-pHILIC column (Merck SeQuant, Sweden; 150 x 2.1 mm, 5 µm particle size) using acetonitrile (A) and 10 mM ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 9.3 (B) as the mobile phase, with gradient elution from 80% A to 20% A in 30 min, at a flow rate of 100 µl/min. Sample injection volume was 1 µl per run.

Mol Biosyst 6:182–198. doi: 10.1039/b908784b PMID:20024080</br>"	"The LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was operated in full scan mode with the scan range of 100-1,000 m/z. Each sample was analyzed twice, once in negative and once in positive ionization mode."	"Peak areas of metabolites of interest, within the raw LC-MS data, were measured using the MZmine 2.10 software and normalized using the peak areas of HEPES and PIPES. The complete workflow and processing parameters are summarized in the publication."	"Metabolites were identified by comparing their m/z values and retention times with authentic pure standards. If no standard was available, metabolites were assigned by analysis of MS/MS spectra (MS/MS), as described in the publication. In cases where no standard compound or MS/MS spectrum was available, compounds were identified by generating chemical formulae using m/z values in MZmine 2.10 module and given MS status."
