STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS626"
Study Title	"Cancer-cell-secreted exosomal miR-105 promotes tumour growth through the Myc-dependent metabolic reprogramming of stromal cells"
Study Description	"Cancer and other cells residing in the same niche engage various modes of interactions to synchronize and to buffer the negative effects of environmental changes. Extracellular miRNAs have been recently implicated in the intercellular crosstalk. Here we show a mechanistic model involving breast-cancer-secreted, extracellular-vesicle-encapsulated miR-105, which is induced by the oncoprotein MYC in cancer cells and in turn activates MYC signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to induce a metabolic program. This results in CAFs metabolic plasticity toenhance glycolysis and glutaminolysis to fuel adjacent cancer cells when nutrients are sufficient (the symbiosis mode), and detoxify metabolic wastes (lactic acid and ammonium) by converting them into energy-rich metabolites, when nutrients are deprived whereas metabolic byproducts are accumulated. This commensalism of cancer stroma emphasizes the functional flexibility of non-cancer cell populations contributing to cancer fitness during sustained growth of tumour."

Study Protocol Description	"Samples include: human cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF; isolated in our lab from a triple-negative human breast tumor), NIH3T3 cells (NIH; obtained from American Type Culture Collection), and mammary tumor tissues collected from female NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma-null mice that had been implanted with a mixture of human cancer cells (PDX; isolated in our lab from a triple-negative human breast tumor) and CAF.  Different treatments, including exosomes carrying varying levels of miR-105, as well as control treatment (with PBS), were applied to the samples.
</p>
Sample preparation was performed as described[1]. Briefly, for experiments with 13C-labelled glucose and glutamine, CAFs pretreated with EVs for 48 hr were incubated with 16.6 mM (3 g/l) D-glucose-13C6 (≥99%; Sigma-Aldrich) in medium free of 12C-glucose, or with 4 mM L-glutamine-13C5,15N2 (98%, 98%; Sigma-Aldrich) in medium free of 12C-glutamine. For experiments with 13C-labelled lactate, pretreated CAFs were cultured in glucose-free medium containing 10 mM lactate for 24 hr, and then changed to glucose-free medium containing 10 mM sodium L-lactate-13C3 (99%; Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were analysed for metabolic profiles after 6 hr. For cell metabolome (CM) analysis, cells were washed after incubating with the tracer for 6 hr, and changed to the corresponding medium containing regular unlabelled (12C) metabolites; CM was collected after 24 hr.

PMID:25621950</br>"	"To determine the abundances of 13C-containing metabolites, cells and the EV-depleted CM were extracted to collect the hydrophilic fraction, which was resuspended in 500 µl 100% D2O containing 5 mM sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories; Tewksbury, MA) that serves as an internal chemical shift reference and a concentration standard in 2D spectra."	"The sample was resuspended in 500 µl D2O with either 5 µM or 5 mM DSS dissolved dry pellet from weighed cells or tumor tissues."	"NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe operating at 600.19 MHz 1H frequency."	"1D NMR spectroscopy was performed described[1]. Briefly, 1D NOESY (nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy) with presaturation spectra[2] was collected with spectral width of 10 kHz, 32k data points, 3s relaxation delay, and 1,024 transients. 2D 1H-13C HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) was used to analyse cell samples and constant-time 1H-13C HSQC was used to analyse medium and tumour samples. The spectrum width for 1H and 13C are 16 ppm and 14 ppm, respectively. The acquisition time for 1H and 13C are 3.4 s and 122 ms, respectively.
