Study Title	"Serum metabolomic profiles identify ER-positive early breast cancer patients at increased risk of disease recurrence in a multicentre population"
Study Description	"Detecting signals of micrometastatic disease in early breast cancer (EBC) patients could improve risk stratification and allow better tailoring of adjuvant therapies. We have previously shown that postoperative serum metabolomic profiles are predictive of relapse in a single-centre cohort of ERnegative EBC patients. Here, we investigated this further using pre-operative serum samples from ER-positive, premenopausal women with EBC who were enrolled in an international phase III trial. </br></br> Methods: Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of 590 EBC samples (319 with relapse or =6 years clinical follow up) and 109 metastatic breast cancer (MBC) samples was performed. A Random Forest (RF) classification model was built using a training set of 85 EBC and all MBC samples. The model was then applied to a test set of 234 EBC samples, and a risk of recurrence score was generated based on the likelihood of the sample being misclassified as metastatic. </br></br> Results: In the training set, the RF model separated EBC from MBC with discrimination accuracy of 84.9%. In the test set, the RF recurrence risk score correlated with relapse, with an area under the curve of 0.747 in receiver operator characteristics analysis. Accuracy was maximised at 71.3% (sensitivity 70.8%, specificity 71.4%). The model performed independently of age, tumor size, grade, HER2 status and nodal status, and also of AdjuvantOnline risk of relapse score.</br> Conclusions: In a multicentre group of EBC patients, we developed a model based on preoperative serum metabolomic profiles that was prognostic for disease recurrence, independent of traditional clinicopathological risk factors."

Study Protocol Description	"Serum samples for analysis were obtained from a bank of blood samples that had been collected during a phase III adjuvant breast cancer clinical trial (NCT00201851) and a parallel phase III MBC clinical trial (NCT00293540) conducted at centers across South East Asia. Both the trials were run by the International Breast Cancer Research Foundation.
</p>
In the adjuvant trial, 740 premenopausal women with stage II-IIIB hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer received surgical oophorectomy at the time of breast cancer surgery (mastectomy), followed by tamoxifen for 5 years, to investigate the hypothesis that surgery performed during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle would be associated with better outcomes. At the time of enrollment, 231 patients were estimated to be in the luteal phase and were scheduled for immediate surgery; 509 patients were estimated not to be in the luteal phase and were randomized to receive either immediate surgery or surgery scheduled to occur in the predicted mid-luteal phase[1]. Blood samples were collected preoperatively in fasted patients on the day of surgery. Frozen sera were initially stored at local sites and then shipped frozen to the United States. Subsequently specimens were shipped still frozen to Italy. No patients were recorded as diabetic. The trial was designed to follow patients for recurrence for at least 6 years, and deidentified clinical outcome data were made available for the purposes of this study. The study was approved at individual participating institutions in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Morocco and/or by supervising Institutional Review Boards for these institutions and at lead investigator's American institutions. The consent processes addressed the use of samples for future research studies.
</p>
In the metastatic trial, premenopausal patients with ER+ MBC were randomized to undergo oophorectomy surgery as palliative endocrine therapy in either the follicular or the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, followed by tamoxifen[2]. Blood samples were collected preoperatively from fasted patients on the day of surgery. Frozen sera were initially stored at local sites and then shipped frozen to the United States. Subsequently specimens were shipped still frozen to Italy. Diabetic status of patients was not recorded.</br>

A total of 450 ml of this mixture was transferred into a 4.25 mm NMR tube (Bruker BioSpin srl) for the analysis."	"1H-NMR spectra for all samples were acquired using a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) operating at 600.13 MHz with a 5 mm CPTCI 1H-13C/31P-2H cryo-probe including a z axis gradient coil, an automatic tuning-matching (ATM) and an automatic sample changer. A BTO 2000 thermocouple served for temperature stabilization at the level of approximately 0.1 K at the sample. Before measurement, samples were kept for at least 3 min inside the NMR probe head for temperature equilibration (310 K for serum samples)."	"One-dimensional (1D) spectra of serum samples were acquired using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG; Bruker) spin-echo sequence to suppress signals arising from high molecular weight molecules."	"Free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential function equivalent to a 1.0 Hz line-broadening factor before applying Fourier transform. Transformed spectra were automatically corrected for phase and baseline distortions and calibrated (anomeric glucose peak at 5.24 ppm) using TopSpin (Version 3.8.4, Bruker). Each 1D spectrum in the range between 0.02 and 10.00 ppm was segmented into 0.02 ppm chemical shift bins, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using AMIX software (Bruker BioSpin). Regions between 6.0 and 4.5 ppm containing residual water were removed."	"Metabolite assignment using AMIX, BBIOREFCODE (Bruker BioSpin) and available literature. The relative concentrations of each metabolite were calculated by fitting the signals in the spectra."
