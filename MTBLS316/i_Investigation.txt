Study Title	"Specific biomarkers for stochastic division patterns and starvation-induced quiescence under limited glucose levels in fission yeast"
Study Description	"Glucose as a source of energy is centrally important to our understanding of life. We investigated the cell division-quiescence behavior of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe under a wide range of glucose concentrations (0-111 mM). The mode of S. pombe cell division under a microfluidic perfusion system was surprisingly normal under highly diluted glucose concentrations (5.6 mM, 1/20 of the standard medium, within human blood sugar levels). Division became stochastic, accompanied by a curious division-timing inheritance, in 2.2-4.4 mM glucose. A critical transition from division to quiescence occurred within a narrow range of concentrations (2.2-1.7 mM). Under starvation (1.1 mM) conditions, cells were mostly quiescent and only a small population of cells divided. Under fasting (0 mM) conditions, division was immediately arrested with a short chronological lifespan (16 h). When cells were first glucose starved prior to fasting, they possessed a substantially extended lifespan (∼14 days). We employed a quantitative metabolomic approach for S. pombe cell extracts, and identified specific metabolites (e.g. biotin, trehalose, ergothioneine, S-adenosyl methionine and CDP-choline), which increased or decreased at different glucose concentrations, whereas nucleotide triphosphates, such as ATP, maintained high concentrations even under starvation. Under starvation, the level of S-adenosyl methionine increased sharply, accompanied by an increase in methylated amino acids and nucleotides. Under fasting, cells rapidly lost antioxidant and energy compounds, such as glutathione and ATP, but, in fasting cells after starvation, these and other metabolites ensuring longevity remained abundant. Glucose-starved cells became resistant to 40 mM H(2)O(2) as a result of the accumulation of antioxidant compounds."

Study Protocol Description	"The wild-type heterothallic haploid 972 h-S. pombe strain was used for the metabolomic experiments. Cells were cultivated in minimal synthetic medium EMM2 with modified glucose content. Limited glucose media were prepared by mixing regular EMM2 (2% glucose) medium with EMM2-G (0% glucose) in the appropriate ratio. The cultivation temperature was 26 °C unless otherwise stated."	"Cells from cultures (40 ml per sample, 5 x 10^6 cells/ml) were collected by vacuum filtration and immediately quenched in –40 °C methanol. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and constant amounts of internal standards (10 nmol of HEPES and PIPES) were added to each sample. Cells were disrupted using a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan) in 500 µl of 50% methanol. Proteins were removed by filtering on an Amicon Ultra 10-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and samples were concentrated by vacuum evaporation. Finally, each sample was resuspended in 20 µl of 50% acetonitrile and 1 µl was used for autosampler injection."	"Each sample was prepared 3 times. LC-MS data were obtained using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). LC separation was performed on a ZIC-pHILIC column (Merck SeQuant, Umeå, Sweden; 150 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 µm particle size). Acetonitrile (A) and 10 mm ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 9.3 (B) were used as the mobile phase, with gradient elution from 80% A to 20% A in 30 min, at a flow rate of 100 µl/min."	"LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. For MS detection, an electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used. Each sample was injected twice (1 µl volume/injection), once with the ESI operated in negative ionization mode and once in positive ionization mode. Spray voltage was set to 2.8 kV (negative ESI) or 4 kV (positive ESI) and capillary temperature to 350 °C or 300 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. The mass spectrometer was operated in a full scan mode with a 100–1000 m/z scan range and automatic data-dependent MS/MS fragmentation scans."	"Raw LC-MS data were analyzed by the MZmine 2 software."	"Metabolites were identified by comparing their m/z values and retention times with authentic pure standards."
