Study Title	"Detection of adulteration in Iranian saffron samples by 1H NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis techniques"
Study Description	"Introduction: The high market value of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) has made it an attractive candidate for adulteration. Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) and tartrazine are among the most common herbal and synthetic foreign materials that may be added to pure saffron for the purpose of adulteration. In spite of encouraging advances achieved in the identification of adulteration in saffron samples, the lack of a simple method with sufficient power for discrimination of pure high grade saffron from meticulously adulterated saffron samples persuaded us to perform this study. Objectives: In this work, we show that 1H NMR spectroscopy together with chemometric multivariate data analysis methods can be used for the detection of adulteration in saffron. Methods: Authentic Iranian saffron samples (n?=?20) and adulterated samples that were prepared by adding either different quantities of natural plant materials such as safflower, or synthetic dyes such as tartrazine or naphthol yellow to pure saffron (n?=?22) composed the training set. This training set was used to build multivariate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) models. The predictive power of the PLS-DA model was validated by testing the model against an external dataset (n?=?13). Results: PCA and PLS-DA models could both discriminate between the authentic and adulterated samples, and the external validation showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for predicting the authenticity of suspicious samples. Peaks specific to authentic and adulterated samples were also characterized. Proximity of samples with unknown adulteration status to the samples adulterated with known compounds in the PCA provided insight regarding the identity of the adulterant in the suspicious samples. Furthermore, the authentic samples could be distinguished based on their cultivation site. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that the application of 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate data analysis is a suitable approach for detection of adulteration in saffron specimens. Outstanding sensitivity and specificity of the PLS-DA model in discriminating the authentic from adulterated samples in external validation confirmed the high predictive power of the model. The advantage of the present method is its power for detecting a wide spectrum of adulterants, ranging from synthetic dyes to herbal materials, in a single assay."

Study Protocol Description	"In total, 20 distinct authentic Iranian saffron samples were collected from reputed providers in Khorasan province, east of Iran. We were able to classify 16 of these samples geographically based on their cultivation sites, to Southern and Northern cultivated samples. 22 adulterated samples were prepared by mixing the pure saffron with different quantities of safflower (purchased from local market branded as “Golrang”), tartrazine or naphthol yellow (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). A separate set of samples was also provided by the Iranian Food and Drug Control Laboratories (FDCL) (n=13). The authenticity of these samples was confirmed by microscopic investigations and information gathered from the food control inspectors. These samples were used as a validation set, and the investigators were blinded to the classification of the samples until the completion of the multivariate analysis."	"800 µl of hot buffered D2O (100 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS), 10 mM NaN3, pH 7) was added to 20 mg of freshly ground samples using mortar and pestle. After 5 min, the mixtures were centrifuged for 5 min at 10000 rpm and the supernatant collected."	"The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7 ± 0.05 by adding appropriate acid/base, if necessary, and 600 µl of each sample was transferred to 5 mm tubes for NMR spectroscopy."	"Regular one-dimensional proton NMR spectra were obtained using a 500-MHz Bruker Ultrashield NMR spectrometer equipped with a TXI probe (5-mm) (Bruker Biospin, Falanden, Switzerland). Additional 2-dimensional NMR experiments were performed for the purpose of confirming chemical shift assignments, including homonuclear total correlation spectroscopy (2D 1H-1H TOCSY) and heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (2D 1H-13C HSQC), using standard Bruker pulse programs."	"The spectra were acquired using a standard pulse sequence that had good water suppression characteristics and is commonly used for metabolite profiling of serum samples. Relaxation delay of 1 s was used; t1 was set to 4 μs and tm had a value of 100 ms. Initial samples for each batch were shimmed to ensure half-height line width of < 1.1 Hz for the dimethyly-silapentane-sulphonate peak, calibrated to 0.0 ppm. Spectra were acquired with 64 scans, then zero filled and Fourier transformed to 128k data points."	"After phase and baseline correction using Topspin correction tools, spectral intensities were scaled to DSS and the spectral region δ = -0.02-10.1 was segmented into bins of 0.04 ppm width. The region of δ 4.70-5.18 ppm was excluded from integration, to eliminate the residual signal of water."	"The pre-processed data was exported to multi-variate statistical analytical software SIMCA-P 14 and analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Univariate scaling was applied to overcome the dominating effect of higher intensity metabolite features. Thus scaling gives equal importance to all the components. Logarithmic transformation was also done before analysis to reduce the effect of data skewness.</br>
</p>
PCA was performed to check the unsupervised segregation of the metabolome. OPLS-DA allowed us to discriminate between the different variables concerning the samples in context. Model significance was assessed using a cross-validated ANOVA with p ≤ 0.05 considered significant. Variables were selected according to the VIP (variable influence on projection) as previously described [1], which are reflective of the correlation of the metabolites towards different response.  VIP > 1 was considered significant.[2]
</p>
Significant metabolites were identified and qualified either by using Chenomx NMR Suite 3.1 Characteristic NMR features of Saffron, Safflower and synthetic dyes software (version 7.5, Edmonton, Alberta, 2013), or were assigned based on literature data [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. Metabolites reported in this study are of Level 2 of metabolite identification, according to the Metabolomics Standard Initiative (MSI) [10].</br>
