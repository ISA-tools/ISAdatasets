Study Title	"Similar, but different: structurally related azelaic acid and hexanoic acid trigger differential metabolomic and transcriptomic responses in tobacco cells"
Study Description	"BACKGROUND: Plants respond to various stress stimuli by activating an enhanced broad-spectrum defensive ability. The development of novel resistance inducers represents an attractive, alternative crop protection strategy. In this regard, hexanoic acid (Hxa, a chemical elicitor) and azelaic acid (Aza, a natural signaling compound) have been proposed as inducers of plant defense, by means of a priming mechanism. Here, we investigated both the mode of action and the complementarity of Aza and Hxa as priming agents in Nicotiana tabacum cells in support of enhanced defense. </br> RESULTS: Metabolomic analyses identified signatory biomarkers involved in the establishment of a pre-conditioned state following Aza and Hxa treatment. Both inducers affected the metabolomes in a similar manner and generated common biomarkers: caffeoylputrescine glycoside, cis-5-caffeoylquinic acid, feruloylglycoside, feruloyl-3-methoxytyramine glycoside and feruloyl-3-methoxytyramine conjugate. Subsequently, quantitative real time-PCR was used to investigate the expression of inducible defense response genes: phenylalanine ammonia lyase, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA quinate transferase and hydroxycinnamoyl transferase to monitor activation of the early phenylpropanoid pathway and chlorogenic acids metabolism, while ethylene response element-binding protein, small sar1 GTPase, heat shock protein 90, RAR1, SGT1, non-expressor of PR genes 1 and thioredoxin were analyzed to report on signal transduction events. Pathogenesis-related protein 1a and defensin were quantified to investigate the activation of defenses regulated by salicylic acid and jasmonic acid respectively. The qPCR results revealed differential expression kinetics and, in general (except for NPR1, Thionin and PR1a), the relative gene expression ratios observed in the Hxa-treated cells were significantly greater than the expression observed in the cells treated with Aza. </br> CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that Aza and Hxa have a similar priming effect through activation of genes involved in the establishment of systemic acquired resistance, associated with enhanced synthesis of hydroxycinnamic acids and related conjugates."

Study Protocol Description	"Nicotiana tabacum cv Samsun cell cultures[1][2] were established from callus derived from sterile, in vitro grown tobacco plants grown from seeds (Agriculture Research Council, Roodeplaat, South Africa). For callus induction, stem and leaf sections were placed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.25 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 0.25 mg/l kinetin (pH 5.8). Cell suspensions were grown in liquid MS medium with the same hormone composition, whilst continuously shaking at 120 rpm in the dark at 25 °C[3-5]. Cells were sub-cultured into fresh medium every 7 d. All of the experiments were conducted 2–3 d after sub-culturing, during the logarithmic stage [6].
</p>
Each experiment was conducted a minimum of 3 times in order to generate the required minimum number of biological replicates required for metabolomics analyses [7-9]. Cell suspensions, as described above, were treated with equimolar concentrations of Aza and Hxa (final concentrations of 100 μM) (Sigma Aldrich, Germany). The 2 inducers were prepared as 10 mM stock solutions, dissolved in MS medium and with the pH adjusted to 5.8 [10]. Naïve (non-treated / non-stimulated cells) exhibited no changes over the 24 h time period and served as a negative controls. Cells were harvested at the selected time points (0, 6, 12 and 24 h) by filtration onto 55 mm circle filter papers using a vacuum filtration system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The cells were transferred into Falcon tubes and cold, sterile MS medium (without any vitamins, hormones and inducing agents) was added to 50 ml to wash the cells free of any original culture medium. Thereafter, the cells were filtered again as described, weighed and processed for extraction.

PMID:25658943</br>"	"The washed and filtered cells were weighed to obtain 1 g of each sample and resuspended in a volume of 10 ml (1:10 m/v) 100% methanol. The suspensions were homogenized using a probe sonicator (Bandelin Sonopuls, Berlin, Germany) set at 55% power for 15 s with 4 cycles. The homogenates were centrifuged at 5100 x g for 15 min at room temperature and the supernatants concentrated to approximately 1 ml on a rotary evaporator set at 50 °C. The resulting volumes were transferred into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and dried to completeness in a heating block set at 50 °C overnight. The dried residues were reconstituted in 500 μl 50% (v/v) UHPLC-grade methanol (Romil Chemistry, Cambridge, UK) in autoclaved milli-Q water, and filtered through a 0.22 μm nylon syringe filter into 300 μl inserts fitted into glass vials with slitted caps. The filtrates were stored at −20 °C until analysis. To ensure reproducibility and account for analytical variability, the obtained results were from 3 independent biological repeats, each analyzed in triplicate (i.e. 3 technical repeats) for all samples. During data acquisition, pooled samples were used for quality control (QC) checks. Sample acquisition was randomized and the QC sample analyzed every 10 injections to monitor and correct changes in the instrument response."	"UHPLC-MS analyses were performed on a Waters Acquity UHPLC system coupled in tandem to a SYNAPT G1 HDMS qTOF mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). The liquid chromatography was carried out on a HSS T3 C18 Acquity UHPLC column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) thermostatted at 60 °C using a gradient elution profile over a total run time of 20 min. The binary solvents utilized consisted of UHPLC grade water (eluent A) and acetonitrile (eluent B) (Romil Pure Chemistry, Cambridge, UK), both containing 0.1% formic acid. The initial conditions were 5% A and gradient elution was introduced to change the chromatographic conditions to 90% B at 16 min and the conditions were kept constant for 1 min; the gradient was then dropped to the initial conditions and held for 2 min. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min whilst an injection volume of 3 μl was used. Separated analytes were detected using a photodiode array detector; scanning range from 200 to 500 nm with 1.2 nm resolution and a sampling rate of 20 points/s."	"The mass spectrometry component used for the detection of separated analytes was a SYNAPT G1 high definition qTOF-MS, used in V-optics and operated in the electrospray ionization (ESI) positive and negative modes. A reference calibrant of leucine enkephalin (50 pg/ml) was used to obtain typical mass accuracies between 1 and 3 mDa. The following parameters were also set up: a capillary voltage of 2.5 kV and the sampling cone voltage at 30 V, trap collision 3 V and the extraction cone at 4 V. The scan time was 0.1 s covering the 100 to 1000 Da range. The source temperature was 120 °C whereas the desolvation temperature was set at 450 °C. Nitrogen gas was used as the nebulization gas at a flow rate of 800 l/h."	"The MassLynx XS 4.1 software (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK) was used for the pre-processing and pre-treatment of the obtained raw data. The MassLynx XS software parameters were set to analyse the 3-10 min retention time (Rt) range of the chromatograms, mass range 100–900 Da, mass tolerance 0.01 Da, mass window 0.05 Da and a Rt window of 0.20 min. The MarkerLynxTM data matrix (of Rt-m/z variable pairs, with the m/z peak intensities for each sample), was exported to the SIMCA (Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy) software, version 14 (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden) for principal component analysis (PCA) using Pareto scaling and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) modeling also using Pareto scaling."	"The selected mass ions from the OPLS-DA-derived S-plots and Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) plots were putatively annotated using the spectral fragmentation patterns (compared to literature) as well as the calculated putative empirical formulae and structures, which were further searched in databases such as the Dictionary of Natural Products (www.dnp.chemnet base.com), ChemSpider (www.chemspider.com) and Knapsack (http://kanaya.naist.jp/KNApSAcK/)."
