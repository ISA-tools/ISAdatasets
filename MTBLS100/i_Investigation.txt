STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS100"
Study Title	"The Human Saliva Metabolome"
Study Description	"Saliva is composed of a variety of molecules that modulate the oral cavity. It is mainly composed of water (95%) and several minor components such as electrolytes, proteins, and low molecular weight compounds. It consists of metabolites from drinks, foods, drugs, environmental contaminants, and bacterial by-products. As part of the ongoing human metabolome project, the human cerebrospinal fluid metabolome, the human serum metabolome, and recently the human urine metabolome have been characterized. Unlike urine, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, saliva metabolomics have not shown much progress. Therefore, the present study aims at characterizing the human saliva metabolome. In an attempt to understand saliva metabolomics, we have undertaken comprehensive multi analytical tools based quantitative metabolomics. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data is presented in this study."

Study Protocol Description	"Human saliva samples were collected from 16 healthy adult volunteers. Collection was done in the early morning before tooth brushing by a standard method [1] consisting of spitting into a 50 ml sterile falcon tube. To assess the effect of sampling time on concentrations of salivary metabolites, samples were also collected three times (before breakfast, 2 hr after breakfast and 2 hr after lunch) in a day. Following collections, the samples were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min to remove particulate matter and the aliquots were stored in eppendorf tubes at -20 °C until analysis. The pH of each sample was measured before processing and analysis. The average pH was 7.22 ± 0.64, which is within the normal range.

Metabolomics, 9(2), pp. 454–463. doi:10.1007/s11306-012-0464-y"	"Saliva samples contain proteins and particulate matter, which affects the quality of proton NMR by interfering with the identification and quantification of metabolites. After thawing and centrifuging, the human saliva samples were deproteinized using ultrafiltration. Prior to filtration, the 0.5 ml, 3 KDa cut-off centrifugal filter units (Millipore Microcon YM-3) were rinsed five times each with 500 μl of HPLC-grade water, then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 mins to remove residual glycerol bound to the filter membranes. Two 500 μl aliquots of each saliva sample were then transferred into the centrifuge filter devices. The samples were then spun at a rate of 10,000 rpm for 35 minutes to remove macromolecules (primarily proteins and lipoproteins) from the sample [1].</br>

"	"A 600 μl aliquot of deproteinized saliva was placed in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube followed by the addition of 70 μl of D2O and 30 μl of a standard buffer solution (25 mM DSS [disodium-2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulphonate], 730 mM imidazole, and 0.47% NaN3 in H2O). The samples (700 μl) were then transferred to a standard 5 mm thin-walled glass NMR tube for subsequent NMR spectral analysis. In total, 16 saliva samples were prepared in this manner. The pH of the samples ranged from 6.5-7.5."	"All 1H-NMR spectra were collected on a 500 MHz Inova (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm HCN Z-gradient pulsed-field gradient (PFG) room-temperature probe. 1H-NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C using the first transient of the Varian tnnoesy-presaturation pulse sequence, which was chosen for its high degree of quantitative accuracy [1].</br>

"All FIDs were zero-filled to 64,000 data points and line broadened 0.5 Hz. The methyl singlet produced by a known quantity of DSS was used as an internal standard for chemical shift referencing (set to 0 ppm) and for quantification. Spectra were collected with 128 transients and 8 steady-state scans using a 4 second acquisition time and a 1 second recycle delay."	"The resulting 1H-NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using the Chenomx NMR Suite Professional software package version 7.7 (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, AB) as previously described [1][2]. Each spectrum was processed and analyzed by two experienced NMR spectroscopists to minimize compound mis-identification and mis-quantification.
