Study Identifier	"MTBLS567"
Study Title	"Intracellular and extracellular metabolites from three strains of Prochlorococcus"
Study Description	"Prochlorococcus is an abundant, cosmopolitan, marine cyanobacterium with ecotypes that vary temporally and spatially across oligotrophic regions of the global ocean. This group of organisms can serve as a model system to understand the accumulation of organic compounds synthesized by primary producers in marine ecosystems. We applied targeted metabolomics to three axenic cultures of strains that span the Prochlorococcus phylogeny: a high-light adapted HLII-clade strain, a low-light adapted LLI-clade strain, and a low-light adapted LLIV-clade strain. Intracellular metabolites were extracted from cells captured in exponential growth and extracellular metabolites were adsorbed, from the same samples, to solid-phase extraction resin. Both pools were quantified using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The resulting data reveal intraspecific differences in metabolites that provide clues about the selective pressures shaping the meta-metabolism of the Prochlorococcus collective, and its interactions with the surrounding microbes that depend on them."

Study Protocol Description	"3 strains of Prochlorococcus were cultured using a natural seawater-based medium[1]. The strains included one high light-adapted strain (MIT9301; HLII) and 2 low light-adapted strains (MIT9313; LLIV and MIT0801; LLI). The cultures were maintained in autoclaved glass tubes and sampled in exponential growth. All 3 strains were grown at light levels of 10 µmol photons/m^2/s; MIT9301 was also grown at 50 µmol photons/m^2/s while MIT9313 was also grown at 5 µmol photons/m^2/s. 
</p>
All 3 strains were grown with replete levels of inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and trace metals[1]. In addition, strain MIT9301 was grown under phosphate-limited conditions with 2.28 µM PO4. The cultures with the replete level of nutrients are 'replete' under the treatment factor, while the cultures grown with limited phosphate are designated as 'Plimited' in the treatment factor. 
</p>
For the replete cultures, there are 3 replicates for the intracellular and extracellular samples from each strain. For the P-limited experiment with MIT9301, there are 2 replicates for the intracellular and extracellular samples.

Limnology and Oceanography Methods 5: 353-362.doi:10.4319/lom.2007.5.353</br>"	"The intracellular metabolites were extracted using a method modified from a previously described protocol[1]. Briefly, the filter was extracted 3 times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and dried in a vacufuge. The samples were redissolved in 95:5 (v/v) water:acetonitrile combined with a mixture of labeled compounds used as an injection standard (d2-biotin, d6-succinic acid, d4-cholic acid, d7-indole 3 acetic acid, 13C phenylalanine; final concentration of each is 0.05 µg/ml). The final extract volume was 150 µl.
</p>
The filtrate for each sample, representing the extracellular metabolite fraction, was processed using solid phase extraction with 1 g/6 cc Bond Elut PPL cartridges[2]. The resulting extract was dried down in a vacufuge. The extracellular metabolite extract was redissolved in 75 µl of 95:5 water:acetonitrile combined with a mixture of labeled compounds used as an injection standard (d2-biotin, d6-succinic acid, d4-cholic acid, d7-indole 3 acetic acid, 13C phenylalanine; final concentration of each is 0.05 µg/ml).

The column was eluted with (A) 0.1% formic acid in water and (B) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The gradient starts at 1% B for 1 min, ramp to 15% B from 1-3 min, ramp to 50% from 3-6 min, ramp to 95% B from 6-9 min, hold until 10 min, ramp to 1% from 10-10.2 min, and a final hold at 1% B (total gradient time 12 min)."	"For targeted analysis, samples were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography (Accela Open Autosampler and Accela 1250 Pump, Thermo Scientific) coupled to a heated electrospray ionization source (H-ESI) and a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ Vantage, Thermo Scientific) operated under selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Separate autosampler injections of 5 μl each were made for positive and negative ion modes. Analysis of authentic standards was used to determine the optimal ionization mode for each metabolite."	"The resulting targeted metabolomics data were converted to mzML files using the msConvert tool[1] and processed with MAVEN[2]. The concentration of the metabolites in the targeted mass spectrometry data is given in ng/cell. The cell count data were obtained by flow cytometry.
