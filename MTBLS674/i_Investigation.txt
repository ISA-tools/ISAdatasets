Study Title	"Biochemical Profiling of the Brain and Blood Metabolome in a Mouse Model of Prodromal Parkinson’s Disease Reveals Distinct Metabolic Profiles (MS assays)"
Study Description	"Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. In the vast majority of cases the origin is not genetic and the cause is not well understood, although progressive accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates appears central to the pathogenesis. Currently, treatments that slow disease progression are lacking, and there are no robust biomarkers that can facilitate the development of such treatments or act as aids in early diagnosis. Therefore, we have defined metabolomic changes in the brain and serum in an animal model of prodromal Parkinson’s disease. We biochemically profiled the brain tissue and serum in a mouse model with progressive synucleinopathy propagation in the brain triggered by unilateral injection of preformed α-synuclein fibrils in the olfactory bulb. In total, we accurately identified and quantified 71 metabolites in the brain and 182 in serum using 1H NMR and targeted mass spectrometry, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, we accurately identified which metabolites explain the most variation between cases and controls. Using pathway enrichment analysis, we highlight significantly perturbed biochemical pathways in the brain and correlate these with the progression of the disease. Furthermore, we identified the top six discriminatory metabolites and were able to develop a model capable of identifying animals with the pathology from healthy controls with high accuracy (AUC (95% CI) = 0.861 (0.755–0.968)). Our study highlights the utility of metabolomics in identifying elements of Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis and for the development of early diagnostic biomarkers of the disease. </br></br> MS assays are reported in the current study MTBLS674 </br> NMR assay is reported in MTBLS640. </br><br/> Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS640' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS640</span></a>"

Study Protocol Description	"C57Bl/6J mice from Jackson Laboratory were housed four to five per cage under regular 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Mice had access to food and water ad libitum.
</p>
Recombinant alpha-syn purification and fibril assembly were based on a previously published protocol[1]. In brief, human alpha-syn was expressed in BL21 E. coli, pelleted, and lysed by sonication. The lysates were boiled for 10 min and centrifuged. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA and then subjected to chromatographic separation by a Superdex 200 Column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and a Hi-trap Q HP anion exchange column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Fractions containing alpha-syn were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining before a final dialysis into PBS buffer (Life Sciences). The concentration of purified recombinant alpha-syn was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher) and concentrated if needed. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C until use. For amyloid fibril assembly, purified recombinant alpha-syn was thawed and diluted to 5 mg/ml in PBS. An aliquot of protein was subject to continuous shaking at 1000 rpm at 37 °C in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf) for 7 days. Fibrils were aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C until use.
</p>
Before injection, human alpha-syn fibrils (PFFs, 5 μg/μl) were thawed at RT and sonicated at RT in a water bath sonicator (Misonix XL2020 sonicator with cup horn; 50% power, 60 pulses of 1 s ON, 1 s OFF). Human alpha-syn monomers (huMonomers) were thawed at RT and spun down at 100,000 x g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and used for injections. We performed stereotactic unilateral injection of PFFs (n = 20) or huMonomers (n = 20) (0.8 μl, 5 μg/μl) in the OB of 2 month old wild-type mice, as previously described[2][3]. 2 mice injected with huMonomers were euthanized after developing severe dermatitis, unrelated to the surgical procedure.
</p>
3 months postinjection, mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. We collected blood at final bleed by cardiac puncture, and the brain was then freshly dissected. The cerebellum was cut out, and the forebrain was sectioned at the midline. The left (contralateral to the injection) and right (ipsilateral to the injection) hemispheres including the olfactory bulbs were collected separately and frozen immediately on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. The blood was collected in BD red top vacutainer tubes for serum collection and kept at RT for 20–30 min to allow blood clot formation. Tubes were then centrifuged at 4500 x g for 10 min at 15 °C. The serum was collected and transferred to precooled vials, vortexed, aliquoted, and frozen on crushed dry ice. Samples were then stored at −80 °C.

In brief, separation of amino acids and biogenic amines was performed using a Waters Acquity I-Class ultrapressure liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Milford, MA) with a Waters Acquity 2.1 mm x 50 mm 1.7 μm BEH C18 column using a reverse phase column (Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 2.1 x 50 mm, 1.7 μm; Wexford, Ireland) coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Xevo TQ-S, Waters Corporation).
