Study Title	"Biological Effects of Amphiphilic Copolymer Nanoparticle-Encapsulated Multi-target Chemotherapeutic Drugs on MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cells"
Study Description	"INTRODUCTION: Amphiphilic copolymer nanoparticle-encapsulated multi-target chemotherapeutic drugs have attracted considerable attention due to their favorable drug efficiency and potential application prospect. Studies have shown that an amphiphilic copolymer, methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) modified with e-polylysine, and encapsulated with hydrophilic doxorubicin, hydrophobic paclitaxel and survivin siRNA profoundly improved the therapeutic effect both in vitro and in vivo.</br>OBJECTIVES: To investigate how MCF-7 cells would response to the exposure of these nanoparticles over with time and assess the biological effects of these nanoparticles and their encapsulated drugs in a holistic manner.</br>METHODS: MCF-7 cells were treated with PBS, nanocarrier and three encapsulated drugs, respectively. Metabolic alterations associated with nano-drugs exposure were investigated by performing untargeted NMR metabolomics with combination of targeted fatty acids analysis by GC-MS on cell extracts. Altered metabolic pathways were further validated by qRT-PCR approach.</br>RESULTS: Copolymers showed great biocompatibility with cells as it induced transit metabolic disruptions without affecting cell survival rate. The rapid release of encapsulated doxorubicin resulted in inhibition of glycolysis and DNA synthesis, active proteolysis; these metabolic alternations were recovered after 10 h exposure. However, the combination use of multiple drugs consistently induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis evidenced by reduction in glycolysis, active proteolysis, stimulated O-GlcNAcylation, reduced the PC:GPC ratio and fatty acids accumulation. Prolonged exposure to encapsulated-multiple-drugs also induced oxidative stress to cells.</br>CONCLUSION: These findings provide important insight into the biological effects of nanoparticles and their encapsulated drugs while demonstrate that metabolomics is a powerful approach to evaluate the biological effects of nano-drugs."

Study Protocol Description	"MCF-7 cells were cultured in 15 cm diameter petri-dishes with 20 ml L-Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (L-DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% 200 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO-Invitrogen Corporation, UK). Cells were incubated at 37 ºC, with 5% CO2. All cultured MCF-7 cells were mixed and homogeneously divided into 150 x 15-cm diameter culture dishes. Before the cell confluence reached about 40%, every 30 dishes were treated with PBS, E-NP, E-NP-D, E-NP-DT and E-NP-DTS, respectively. Alive cells (n=10) were collected from each group at different time intervals: 10 h, 24 h, and 36 h post treatment. Cells were washed with 10 ml 4 ºC PBS and trypsinized by adding 0.25% trypsin supplemented with 0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (GIBCO-Invitrogen Corporation, UK). Before cells starting to detach from culture dishes, trypsin was removed immediately. PBS was added to suspend the cells. Cells were then transferred to a 2 ml centrifuge tube and gently washed for 3 times with 4 ºC PBS before being stored at -80 ºC."	"Cell pellets were homogenized in 600 µl methanol/H2O (2:1 v/v) solution and subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles to lyse the cells. Sonication was performed in ice for 15 min with cycles consisting of 1-min power followed by 1-min stop. Supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 12000 x g for 10 min at 4 ºC. The remaining cell residues were further extracted twice using the above-mentioned procedure. The supernatant from the 3 extractions was pooled together and lyophilized after removal of methanol using SpeedVac (ThermoFisher, America)."	"The cell extracts were dissolved in 600 ml phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 99.9% D2O) containing 0.001% TSP-d4. After centrifugation at 16000 x g for 10 min at 4 ºC, 550 µl of the supernatants was transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes for NMR analysis."	"1H NMR spectra of cell extracts were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm CPTCI 1H-13C/15N/D Z-GRD cryogenic probe (Bruker, Biospin, Germany)."	"1D NMR spectra were recorded with water resonance presaturation applying a 1D NOESY sequence for suppressing resonances with a recycle delay (2 s) and mixing time (80 ms) using the Bruker pulse program, noesygppr1d. The first increment of NOESY sequence was used.  The number of acquistion was 64. All 1H NMR spectra were multiplied by an exponential function with a 1 Hz line broadening factor before Fourier transformation (FT). The spectra were referenced to the TSP methyl resonance (d 0.000). "	"The spectral region d 0.5-9.5 was integrated into regions with an equal width of 0.002 ppm (1.2 Hz) using an AMIX software package (V3.9.2, Bruker Biospin, Germany). Regions d 4.591-5.039 and d 3.707-3.729 were discarded to avoid the effects of water saturation and exogenous PEG, respectively. Each integral bucket was normalized to the sum of the total integrals prior to statistical analysis."	"Metabolite assignment was accomplished with the assistance of a series of two dimensional NMR spectra including 1H-1H COSY, 1H-1H TOCSY, 1H J-resolved, 1H-13C HSQC and 1H-13C HMBC; Small signals were confirmed by standard compounds as well."
