Study Title	"N-glycosylation Profiling of Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines Reveals Association of Fucosylation with Differentiation and Caudal Type Homebox 1 (CDX1)/Villin mRNA Expression."
Study Description	"Various cancers such as colorectal cancer (CRC) are associated with alterations in protein glycosylation. CRC cell lines are frequently used to study these (glyco)biological changes and their mechanisms. However, differences between CRC cell lines with regard to their glycosylation have hitherto been largely neglected. Here, we comprehensively characterized the N-glycan profiles of 25 different CRC cell lines, derived from primary tumors and metastatic sites, in order to investigate their potential as glycobiological tumor model systems and to reveal glycans associated with cell line phenotypes. We applied an optimized, high-throughput membrane-based enzymatic glycan release for small sample amounts. Released glycans were derivatized to stabilize and differentiate between a2,3- and a2,6-linked N-acetylneuraminic acids, followed by N-glycosylation analysis by MALDI-TOF(/TOF)-MS. Our results showed pronounced differences between the N-glycosylation patterns of CRC cell lines. CRC cell line profiles differed from tissue-derived N-glycan profiles with regard to their high-mannose N-glycan content but showed a large overlap for complex type N-glycans, supporting their use as a glycobiological cancer model system. Importantly, we could show that the high-mannose N-glycans did not only occur as intracellular precursors but were also present at the cell surface. The obtained CRC cell line N-glycan features were not clearly correlated with mRNA expression levels of glycosyltransferases, demonstrating the usefulness of performing the structural analysis of glycans. Finally, correlation of CRC cell line glycosylation features with cancer cell markers and phenotypes revealed an association between highly fucosylated glycans and CDX1 and/or villin mRNA expression that both correlate with cell differentiation. Together, our findings provide new insights into CRC-associated glycan changes and setting the basis for more in-depth experiments on glycan function and regulation."

Study Protocol Description	"Colorectal cancer cell lines were cultured T75 culture flasks in RPMI medium with L-glutamine (LUMC) or DMEM medium (VUmc), supplemented with antibiotics and 10% FCS. Cells were harvested and aliquoted to 2x10^6 cells, washed with PBS and stored at -20 °C until further use."	"N-glycans were released with PNGase F from 250 000 cells in quadruplates using a 96-well PVDF-membrane based protocol [1]. Released N-glycans were: i) derivatized by ethyl esterification [2], purified using cotton-HILIC micro-SPE [3] and measured by MALDI-TOF-MS (assay A) and MS/MS for structural elucidation (LIFT; assay B); ii) labeled with 2-AA [4], purified by cotton-HILIC micro-SPE, and analysed by nano-RP-LC-ESI-ion trap-MS/MS for glycan fragmentation analysis (assay C).

Samples were first concentrated onto a trap column (Acclaim PepMap100 C18 column, 100 µm × 2 cm, C18 particle size 5 µm, pore size 100 Å, Thermo Scientific) prior to separation on an Acclaim PepMap RSLC nano-column (75 µm × 15 cm, C18 particle size 2 µm, pore size 100 Å, Thermo Scientific) at a flow rate of 700 nl/min and a multistep linear gradient (t=0-5 min, c(B)=3%; t=35 min, c(B)=27%; t=40-45 min, c(B)=70%; t=46-58 min, c(B)=3% with 0.1% formic acid in water as solvent A, and 95% ACN and 5% water as solvent B)."	"For assays A and B, derivatized N-glycans (see i) in Extraction protocol) were spotted onto an anchor chip MALDI target plate (Bruker Daltonics) and co-crystallized with superDHB in ACN/mQ (1/1, v/v) containing 1 mM NaOH. MALDI-TOF-MS spectra were acquired using an UltrafleXtreme mass spectrometer in the positive-ion reflector mode, controlled by FlexControl 3.4 software Build 119 (Bruker Daltonics) over a mass window of m/z 1000-5000 with complete random walk settings. The instrument was calibrated using a Bruker peptide calibration kit.
</p>
For assay B, tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) was performed for structural elucidation via fragmentation in gas-off TOF/TOF mode (LIFT).
</p>
For assay C, AA-labeled glycans (see ii) in Extraction protocol) were analysed on a AmazonSpeed ion trap (Bruker Daltonics) with a CaptiveSpray nanoBooster (Bruker Daltonics) for mass spectrometric MS/MS analysis using a captive spray for ionization of samples in the positive ion mode. For the electrospray (1300 V), fused silica capillaries with an internal diameter of 20 µm were used. Solvent evaporation was achieved at 220 °C with an ACN enriched nitrogen nebulizer gas at a pressure of 0.2 bar. Tandem MS was performed automated on the seven highest precursors per MS with ion detection from m/z 100 to 3000)."	"MALDI-TOF-MS spectra were exported to xy files using FlexAnalysis(Version 3.3; Bruker Daltonics), LC-ESI-MS/MS spectra were converted to mzXL using ProteoWizard3.0.5622. LIFT spectra are kept as FlexAnalysis files."	"Peaklists were analyzed in GlycoWorkbench 2.1 stable build 146 (http://www.eurocarbdb.org/) and glycan compositions annotated using the Glyco-Peakfinder tool (http://www.eurocarbdb.org/ms-tools/). MS/MS data was manually annotated using FlexAnalysis(Version 3.3; Bruker Daltonics) and DataAnalysis 4.2 Build 387 (Bruker Daltonics)."
