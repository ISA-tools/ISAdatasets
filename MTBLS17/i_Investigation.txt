Study Identifier	"MTBLS17"
Study Title	"Utilization of Metabolomics to Identify Serum Biomarkers for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis"
Study Description	"Characterizing the metabolic changes pertaining to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with liver cirrhosis is believed to contribute towards early detection, treatment, and understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HCC. we compare metabolite levels in sera of 78 HCC cases with 184 cirrhotic controls by using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF MS). Several candidate metabolic biomarkers for early detection of HCC cases in high risk population of cirrhotic patients are identified using mass spectrum."

Study Protocol Description	"The participants in this study comprised adult patients, who were prospectively recruited from the hepatology clinics at Georgetown University Hospital (GUH), Washington, DC. All patients provided informed consent and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Georgetown University. All patients were diagnosed to have liver cirrhosis on the basis of established clinical, laboratory and/or imaging criteria. Cases were diagnosed to have HCC based on well-established diagnostic imaging criteria and/or histology. Controls were required to be HCC free for at least 6 months from the time of study entry. Human blood was drawn from adult patients and collected by venepuncture into 10 ml BD Vacutainer sterile vacuum tubes without the presence of anticoagulant. The blood was immediately centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The serum supernatant was carefully collected and centrifuged at 2500 x g for 10 min at room temperature. After aliquoting, serum was kept frozen at -80 °C until use. Primary tubes and serum aliquots were labeled using anonymous confidential code numbers with no personal identifiers. Identification codes were cross-referenced with clinical information in a pass code protected computer system."	"Frozen human serum was thawed at room temperature and 25 µl serum was mixed with 1.5 ml 66% ACN containing two internal standards (debrisquinone 1 µg/ml for positive mode and nitrobenzoic acid 10 µg/ml for negative mode), vortexed and incubated for 10 min on ice. Mixture was then spun at 10,000  x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant organic solution was transferred, speed-vacuum dried at room temperature and reconstituted in 50 µl of mobile phase (2% ACN containing 0.1 % formic acid) ready for injection."	"From each sample, 5 μl was injected onto a reverse-phase 50 × 2.1 mm ACQUITY 1.7-μm C18 column (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) using an ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) with a gradient mobile phase consisting of 2% ACN in water containing 0.1% formic acid (A) and 2% water in ACN containing 0.1% formic acid (B). Each sample was resolved for 10 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The gradient consisted of 100% A for 0.5 min then a ramp of curve 6 to 60% B from 0.5 min to 4.0 min, then a ramp of curve 6 to 100% B from 4.0-8.0 min, a hold at 100% B until 9.0 min, then a ramp of curve 6 to 100% A from 9.0 min to 9.2 min, followed by a hold at 100% A until 10 min."	"The column eluent was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer by electrospray.Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a Q-TOF Premier (Waters) operating in both positive and negative mode. The capillary voltage was set to 3.2 kV and 3 kV, and the cone voltage of 30 V and 20 V, respectively. The desolvation gas flow was set to 800 l/h and the temperature was set to 350 °C. The cone gas flow was 25 l/h, and the source temperature was 120 °C. Accurate mass was maintained by introduction of LockSpray interface of sulfadimethoxine (311.0814 [M+H]+ or 309.0658 [M-H]-) at a concentration of 250 pg/μl in 50% aqueous ACN and a rate of 150 μl/min. UPLC-QTOF data were acquired in centroid mode from 50 to 850 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) in MS scanning using the MassLynx software (Waters)."	"The raw data were converted into Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) format using the MassLynx software (Waters). We used the XCMS package to preprocess each of the three UPLC-QTOF MS datasets separately. The first step in XCMS is to detect the peaks. The peak detection algorithm first cuts the UPLC-QTOF data into slices, a fraction of a mass unit wide, and then applies a model peak matched filter on those individual slices over the chromatographic time domain. After detecting peaks in individual samples, the peaks are matched across samples to allow calculation of retention time (RT) deviations and relative ion intensity comparison. This is accomplished using a grouping method that uses kernel density estimation to group peaks in the mass domain. The peak matching algorithm in XCMS takes into account the two-dimensional anisotropic nature of data. These groups are then used to identify and correct drifts in RT from run to run. Following data preprocessing, ion annotation is conducted to identify derivative ions such as isotopes, adducts, and in-source fragments. This helps group ions that originated from the same metabolite on the basis of their monoisotopic masses and elution profiles. We used the R-package CAMERA for ion annotation."	"For difference detection, in-house developed MATLAB (Natick, MA) and R scripts were used on the basis of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests (t-test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In both statistical tests, we calculated the false discovery rate (FDR) to correct for multiple testing. To select ions with significant and consistent changes between HCC and cirrhotic patients in multiple experiments, we used an ion-annotation-assisted approach. This approach is designed to determine overlapping ions among multiple experiments by taking into consideration the presence of a large number of derivative ions such as isotopes, adducts, and fragments. This is accomplished by grouping ions into clusters, where each ion in a cluster is represented by its monoisotopic mass. This mass is then used to compare the ions across the three experiments. The common ions obtained based on monoisotopic masses using the ion annotation information are merged with those selected on the basis of their ion masses only. Putative identifications for the resulting ion list were obtained through mass-based search against four databases: the Human Metabolite DataBase (HMDB), Metlin, Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD), and LIPID MAPS. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) and MetaboAnalyst (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/) were used to perform enrichment analysis on a list of putative identifications of altered metabolites to identify a biological pathway that can be further investigated. Identities of some of the putative metabolite identifications were verified by comparing their MS/MS fragmentation patterns and RT with those of authentic standard compounds. Absolute quantitation of metabolite candidates was performed using isotope dilution technique by UPLC-SRM-MS analysis on the QTRAP 4000 and XEVO TQ instruments."
