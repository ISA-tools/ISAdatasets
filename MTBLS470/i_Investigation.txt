Study Title	"A Metabonomic Comparison of Human Serum and Plasma Subtypes Using Untargeted NMR Spectroscopy and UPLC-MS (NMR assays)"
Study Description	"INTRODUCTION: Differences in the metabolite profiles between serum and plasma are incompletely understood. </br> OBJECTIVES: To evaluate metabolic profile differences between serum and plasma and among plasma sample subtypes. </br> METHODS: We analyzed serum, platelet rich plasma (PRP), platelet poor plasma (PPP), and platelet free plasma (PFP), collected from 8 non-fasting apparently healthy women, using untargeted standard 1D and CPMG 1H NMR and reverse phase and hydrophilic (HILIC) UPLC-MS. Differences between metabolic profiles were evaluated using validated principal component and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. </br> RESULTS: Explorative analysis showed the main source of variation among samples was due to inter-individual differences with no grouping by sample type. After correcting for inter-individual differences, lipoproteins, lipids in VLDL/LDL, lactate, glutamine, and glucose were found to discriminate serum from plasma in NMR analyses. In UPLC-MS analyses, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysoPE)(18:0) and lysophosphatidic acid(20:0) were higher in serum, and phosphatidylcholines (PC)(16:1/18:2, 20:3/18:0, O-20:0/22:4), lysoPC(16:0), PE(O-18:2/20:4), sphingomyelin(18:0/22:0), and linoleic acid were lower. In plasma subtype analyses, isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, glutamate, and pyruvate were higher among PRP samples compared with PPP and PFP by NMR while lipids in VLDL/LDL, citrate, and glutamine were lower. By UPLC-MS, PE(18:0/18:2) and PC(P-16:0/20:4) were higher in PRP compared with PFP samples. </br> CONCLUSIONS: Correction for inter-individual variation was required to detect metabolite differences between serum and plasma. Our results suggest the potential importance of inter-individual effects and sample type on the results from serum and plasma metabolic phenotyping studies. </br></br> NMR protocols and data are reported in the current study MTBLS470. </br> UPLC-MS protocols and data associated to this study are reported in MTBLS465. </br><br/> Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS465' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS465</span></a>"

Study Protocol Description	"For preparation of serum and plasma, blood was collected from 8 apparently healthy non-fasting middle-aged female volunteers into 10 ml Serum Separator Tubes (SST; containing clot activator and serum separator gel) and 10-ml lithium heparin venipuncture tubes, respectively (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Blood collected into serum tubes was inverted 5 times and allowed to clot at room temperature (RT) for 45 min prior to centrifugation (2000 x g for 10 min at RT).
</p>
Platelet rich plasma (PRP), platelet poor plasma (PPP), and platelet free plasma (PFP) were prepared from blood collected into lithium heparin tubes. PRP was prepared by centrifugation at 200 x g  for 10 min (no brake); PPP was centrifuged at 2000 x g for 10 min (low brake); and, PFP was prepared by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 10 min (low brake), aliquoting the plasma into 1-ml conical vials, followed by a second centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 7 min (all at RT). Following centrifugation, samples were aliquoted into 1-ml conical vials and frozen at -80 °C."	"No extractions were performed in this study."	"Frozen serum samples (-80 °C) were thawed and then centrifuged at 2700 x g for 10 min to remove particulates and precipitated proteins. 300 μl of individual serum samples were prepared with pH 7.4 phosphate buffer for high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy as described previously[1].

PMID:25180432</br>"	"The serum samples were analysed using 1H NMR spectroscopy 1H NMR standard 1D (NOESYPR1D) with water pre-saturation and CPMG spectra were recorded on a 600 MHz Avance III Bruker NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) operating at 600.13 MHz performed to maximise metabolite coverage. All experiments were performed with 32 scans, a 10 ms mixing time, and 96,000 data points at a temperature of 310 K."	"The serum samples were analysed using 1H NMR spectroscopy with 2 different pulse sequences. The first, the so-called noesy-presat sequence, provides an overview of all proton-containing species and yields sharp peaks for small molecule species, broad bands from the lipoproteins (used later for lipoprofile analysis, see below) and a broad largely featureless-background from proteins, the most abundant being albumin. The second pulse sequence, the so-called Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence, takes advantage of the different nuclear spin relaxation times between large and small molecules to attenuate the peaks from large molecules (those with shorter spin-spin relaxation times) to leave mainly small molecule metabolite peaks. The main data analysis was performed using the CPMG spectral data and the lipoprotein profiling was carried out using the noesy-presat spectral data. For the CPMG spectra a relaxation delay (RD) of 4 s, a mixing time of 0.01 s, a spin-echo delay of 0.3 ms, 128 loops and a free induction decay (FID) acquisition time (ACQ) of 3.067 s were used. A total of 32 scans were recorded into 96k data points with a spectral width of 20 ppm."	"The acquired 1H-NMR spectra were zero-filled to 128k points, Fourier transformed, phase and baseline corrected using Bruker Topspin 3.1 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). The serum spectra were referenced to the anomeric proton assigned to α-glucose at δ5.22 and imported to MATLABTM (R2014a, The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) for further analysis. Regions corresponding to the water peak (δ4.3 to 4.925) were removed. All spectra were normalized using probabilistic quotient normalization using the mean spectrum as the reference."	"Confirmation of metabolite identities in the NMR data was obtained using 1D and 2D NMR experiments, spike-in of chemical standards, J-Resolved spectroscopy (JRES), TOtal Correlation SpectroscopY (TOCSY), and Hetero-nuclear 1H-13C Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy)."
