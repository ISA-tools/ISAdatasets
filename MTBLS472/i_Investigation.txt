Study Title	"ER stress inhibits liver fatty acid oxidation while unmitigated stress leads to anorexia-induced lipolysis and both liver and kidney steatosis"
Study Description	"The unfolded protein response (UPR), induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, regulates the expression of factors that restore protein folding homeostasis. However, in the liver and kidney, ER stress also leads to lipid accumulation, accompanied at least in the liver by transcriptional suppression of metabolic genes. The mechanisms of this accumulation are unclear, including which pathways contribute to the phenotype in each organ. We combined gene expression profiling, biochemical assays, and untargeted lipidomics to understand the basis of stress-dependent lipid accumulation, taking advantage of enhanced hepatic and renal steatosis in mice lacking the ER stress sensor ATF6α. We found that impaired fatty acid oxidation contributed to the early development of steatosis in the liver, but not the kidney; while anorexia-induced lipolysis promoted late triglyceride and free fatty acid accumulation in both organs. These findings provide evidence for both direct and indirect regulation of peripheral metabolism by ER stress."

Study Protocol Description	"Animals were housed in a pathogen-free facility under climate controlled conditions with a 12-hr light/dark cycle, and were maintained on standard rodent chow. All procedures were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Atf6-/- animals have been backcrossed into the C57BL/6J strain for >10 generations. 8-to-10 week-old animals of both genders were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg/kg TM (EMD) dissolved in DMSO and diluted in 150 mM dextrose or PBS, or an equivalent concentration of DMSO alone in dextrose (for all nontreated animals). At sacrifice, plasma was collected and liver and kidney tissues were harvested and either used fresh (for biochemical assays), fixed in formalin (for immunostaining), frozen in OCT (for Oil Red O staining), or flash frozen in liquid N2 (for molecular analysis and mass spectrometry). Tissue triglyceride measurement[1], immunostaining[2], Oil Red O staining[1], and qRT-PCR[3] were performed as described. For metabolic cage experiments, animals were habituated to cages for 5 days, and then treated with 1 mg/kg TM and monitored for a further 2 days.

PMID:17090218</br>"	"Frozen liver or kidney pieces were pulverized using a metal cup and mallet. 100 mg of frozen liver or kidney powder was added to 2 ml of a 2:1 chloroform:methanol mixture in a 5 ml glass flat-bottom tube with a Teflon cap liner. Heptadecanoic acid was spiked into the sample at 0.5 ng/µl as an internal standard. The sample was sonicated on ice with a probe sonicator for 60 s, and then 1 ml of H2O was added, the sample was vortexed for 30 s, incubated on ice for 30 min, and revortexed. Following centrifugation for 15 min at 200 x g at 4 °C, the bottom layer was removed, transferred to a new tube, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, and resuspended in 200 µl of 2:1 chloroform:methanol."	"The chromatographic separation was done using a Phenomenex Gemini C18 column (4.6 x 50 mm, 5 µm). The mobile phase was 95:5 Water/Methanol (v/v) in Solvent A and 65:35:5 Isopropanol/Methanol/Water (v/v/v). Depending on whether positive or negative ESI was being used either 0.1% Formic Acid or Ammonium Hydroxide was added to both solvents, respectively. The gradient initially held for 5 min at 100% A at a flow rate of 100 µl/min. At 5.1 minutes, flow rate increased to 400 µl/min. Over the next 40 min, gradient increased to 100% B at which point the flow rate was increased to 500 µl/min. The system was held at 100% B for 18 min and then re-equilibrated back to 100% A over 7 min. Injection volume was 15 µl for all samples. The column was held at 25 °C throughout the run."	"The samples were analyzed by LC-MS using a Waters Q-TOF Premier mass spectrometer interfaced with an Acquity UPLC system. Electrospray ionization was used and data collected in both positive and negative ion modes using Leucine Enkephalin as the lock mass. The MS conditions were as follows for both positive and negative ESI: capillary voltage 2.8 KV, sampling cone voltage 35 V, source temperature 110 °C, desolvation gas temperature 400 °C, cone gas flow 30 l/hr, and desolvation gas flow 750 l/hr. Data were collected over the mass range 130 to 1000 Da. LC-MS data acquisition and analysis were performed by using Waters MassLynx software. The quantification of the fatty acids was performed utilizing QuanLynx software package using standard curves for oleic, linoleic, palmitic, and stearic acids."	"The data files were converted to NetCDF format using DataBridge conversion software for further processing in XCMS. CDF files were uploaded to the XCMS website (xcmsonline.scripps.edu) to create individual datasets. The datasets were then compared using pairwise analysis with the UPLC/Q-TOF parameter. The results table was filtered using the following parameters: FDR-adjusted p-value less than or equal to 0.01, fold greater than or equal to 1.5, max intensity greater than or equal to 5000. These same parameters were applied to generate the red/green cloud plots."	"The mass-to-charge ratio from the species that fit the parameters was entered into the Lipid Maps online website search tool for the LIPID MAPS Structure Database (www.lipidmaps.org/tools/ms/LMSD_search-mass-options.php) and Metlin with the following parameters: [M+NH4]+ and [M+H]+(for positive run), [M-H]- (for negative run), Mass Tolerance of 0.1. The top hit was chosen for the lipid ID, after adjustment for the most plausible adducts given the LC conditions. For triglycerides, the top hit that had all even chain carbons was chosen for the ID. Metabolite identifcations were only speculative as neither tandem mass spectrometry analysis nor confirmation by comparison to authenitc standards was done."
