Study Title	"The Genome of Medicinal Plant Macleaya cordata Provides New Insights into Benzylisoquinoline Alkaloids Metabolism"
Study Description	"The overuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture and medicine has caused a series of potential threats to public health. Macleaya cordata is a medicinal plant species from the Papaveraceae family, providing a safe resource for the manufacture of antimicrobial feed additive for livestock. The active constituents from M. cordata are known to include benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) such as sanguinarine (SAN) and chelerythrine (CHE), but their metabolic pathways have yet to be studied in this non-model plant. The active biosynthesis of SAN and CHE in M. cordata was first examined and confirmed by feeding 13C-labeled tyrosine. To gain further insights, we de novo sequenced the whole genome of M. cordata, the first to be sequenced from the Papaveraceae family. The M. cordata genome covering 378 Mb encodes 22,328 predicted protein-coding genes with 43.5% being transposable elements. As a member of basal eudicot, M. cordata genome lacks the paleohexaploidy event that occurred in almost all eudicots. From the genomics data, a complete set of 16 metabolic genes for SAN and CHE biosynthesis was retrieved, and 14 of their biochemical activities were validated. These genomics and metabolic data show the conserved BIA metabolic pathways in M. cordata and provide the knowledge foundation for future productions of SAN and CHE by crop improvement or microbial pathway reconstruction."

Study Protocol Description	"Various wild lines of Macleaya cordata were collected from different places in China with no permission required, and cultivated at Hunan Agricultural University. The line with highest content of SAN and CHE originated from Fujian province (FJ1, available as seeds upon request; geographic coordinates: 27°46'23.408"N and 117°25'12.560"E) and further propagated via tissue culture to generate the plantlets for isotopic tracking assay, metabolic analysis, genome sequencing, RNA-seq, qRT–PCR, and gene cloning, which would reduce heterozygosity of the line down to a single diploid genome and ensure the samples used in the following experiments have the same genetic background.
</p>
Macleaya cordata regenerated plantlets was grown in an MS medium for 60 days (plant height: 10-12 cm). 4 ml of isotopically labeled [ring-13C6]-tyrosine (0.4 mg/ml) was added to the medium in a plastic bottle which had 1 regenerated plantlets, and non-labeled tyrosine was added as a control. 3 biological replicates of 1 regenerated plantlet were performed. The plastic bottles (diameter: 4 cm, height: 15 cm) were closed and exposed to constant illumination at 2000 lux (warm white fluorescent lamps) at 26 °C. 3 biological replicates of a regenerated plantlet (3 plantlets in total) were harvested 6 days later and metabolites were isolated as described in Extraction protocol below.  The fresh roots, leaves, stems of regenerated plantlets were ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen and freeze drying was used to obtain the dried plant material."	"The fresh roots, leaves, stems, flowers, and capsules of 1-year-old FJ1 grown at the Hunan Agricultural University were ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen, and freeze drying was used to obtain the dried plant material. A 30-min ultrasonic extraction procedure with 25 ml of methanol was then applied to isolate potential metabolites from 50 mg of dried plant material powder at room temperature. After filtration through a 0.22-µm membrane filter (Pall), the solution was analyzed using LC/quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS."	"Chromatographic separation was performed on an ultra-HPLC Agilent 1290 instrument (Agilent, USA) using an X-aqua C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 5 µm, Acchrom, China). The mobile phase consisted of a 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (v/v, solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile (v/v, solvent B). The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min, and the injection volume was 1 µl. The gradient was set as follows: 0-1 min, a linear gradient of 5-10% B; 1-6 min, a linear gradient to 30% B; 6-7 min, a linear gradient to 38% B; 7-9 min, an isocratic of 38% B; 9-15 min, a linear gradient to 60% B; 15-25 min, a linear gradient to 75% B; 25.1-30 min, an isocratic elution of 95% B; 35.1-35 min, an isocratic elution of 5% B. The automatic sampler temperature was set at room temperature."	"UHPLC was coupled with Q/TOF MS (6530A, Agilent, USA). Data acquisition was performed in positive ionization and full scan modes (m/z: 100-1000). Spray parameters were set as follows: Gas temperature, 350 °C; Gas flow, 11 l/min; Nebulizer, 32 psi; Sheath gas temperature, 350 °C; Sheath gas flow, 10 l/min; Vcap voltage, 4,000 V; Nozzle voltage, 500 V; Fragment voltage, 135 V. The other settings varied depending on tuning. Purine (C5H4N4, m/z: 121.0508, Agilent, USA) and HP-0921 (C18H18O6N3P3F24, m/z: 922.0097, Agilent, USA) were used for mass calibration."	"Centroid LC-Q/TOF MS data were processed using Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (B.05.00).  Raw data files (.d format) were converted to mzData format."	"Monoisotopic masses of the protonated molecular ions [M+H]+ were calculated using the data explorer software of the Q/TOF instrument.  Identification of alkaloids was accomplished using retention times (RTs) and exact mass (<5 ppm.) of the monoisotopic mass of the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+ or radical molecular ion [M]+. Authentic standards were used to confirm the identity of the intermediates.
</p>
The [ring-13C6]-labeled various mass peaks were extracted from the total ion chromatogram by adding the exact mass of 6.02013 ([M+H+6.02013]+). These labeled target compounds were confirmed by comparing their retention times (RTs) and exact mass in MS spectra with their unlabeled authentic standards."
