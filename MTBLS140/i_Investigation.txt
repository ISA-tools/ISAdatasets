Study Title	"Metabolome analysis via an HPLC-ESI-MS-based experimental and computational pipeline for chronic nephron toxicity profiling"
Study Description	"Untargeted metabolomics has the potential to improve the predictivity of in vitro toxicity models and therefore may aid the reduction of expensive and laborious animal models. Here we describe a chronic nephrotoxicity study conducted on a human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line (RPTEC/TERT1) treated with low (10 µM) and high (35 µM) concentrations of chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) – a known nephrotoxic compound. The presented toxicity study followed two major strategies; the first was to establish an automated and easy to use untargeted metabolomics workflow for HPLC-MS data and second to find time- and dose dependent toxicant-induced cell responses at the metabolite level. The metabolomic changes were integrated with transcriptomics and proteomics data to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the mode of action. Automated data analysis workflows based on open-source software (OpenMS and KNIME) enable a comprehensive and reproducible analysis of the complex and voluminous metabolomics data produced by the profiling approach. For toxicity profiling of CAA, 428 and 317 metabolite features were detectable in positive and negative mode, respectively, after removal of chemical noise and unstable signals. Changes upon treatment were visually explored using principal component analysis and statistically significant differences identified using linear models (LIMMA). The analysis revealed toxic effects only for the high concentration treatment for day 3 and day 14. The most regulated metabolites were glutathione and metabolites related to the oxidative stress response of the cells. These findings are corroborated by proteomics and transcriptomics data, which show, amongst others, an activation of the Nrf2 pathway."

Study Protocol Description	"The human renal proximal tubule cell line RPTEC/TERT1 was obtained from Evercyte GmbH (Vienna, Austria). The RPTEC/TERT1 cells [1] were cultured on 1 µm PET 24 mm tissue culture inserts for MTX and PTX, and on 0.2 µm aluminium oxide 25 mm inserts for TCX, and differentiated as previously described [2]. Briefly, cells were grown in a serum-free hormonally-defined medium for epithelial monolayer maturation and CAA exposure. After reaching a stable average trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of ~ 150 Ohm.cm^2, mature monolayers were exposed to either a high (35 µmol/l) or low (10 µmol/l) concentration of CAA or control medium, on both the apical and the basolateral sides [3].

"The cell culture medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by an additional very rapid washing step with ammonium bicarbonate (185 mM, 289 mOsm, pH 7.8; Sigma-Aldrich). To preserve metabolites, 750 µl ice cold methanol containing deutero-alanine (50 µM) as internal standard were added. Two wells were pooled in an Eppendorf tube, vortexed and sonicated with an in-probe-sonicator from Branson Ultrasonics Corporation (Danbury, CT, USA) for 20 s to fully homogenize the sample. Finally, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C at 14000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was used for MTX and was stored at -80 °C until analysis."	"RP-HPLC-separations were performed at an Accela II HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a 100 x 2.1 mm i.d. Hypersil Gold aQ column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) packed with 1.9 µm particles. Water (A) and acetonitrile (B) each containing 0.10 % (v/v) formic acid were used as eluents. The flow rate was 0.30 ml/min, and gradient elution was carried out as follows: 100% A for 1.5 minutes followed by a linear gradient to 100% B in 6.5 min and holding for 2 min. In the end a re-equilibration step was performed for 3.0 min at 0.0% B. The total run time was 13 minutes. The column temperature was maintained at 30 °C and 2.7 µl of sample was injected per run."	"An Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a heated-electrospray ion source operating in the positive or negative ion mode. An ESI heater temperature of 350 °C was chosen and sheath gas and aux gas flow rates were set to 20 and 5.0 arbitrary units in positive mode and to 35 and 10 in the negative mode, respectively. A sprayer voltage of 3.0 kV was applied and the resolution was set to 50,000. The mass range was split into a low mass range m/z 50-200 and a high mass range m/z 200-1000 and measured in two separate runs. The MS parameters were tuned for each method and polarity separately with selected metabolites. For the low mass range the best intensities were achieved with a capillary voltage of 25 V, tube lens voltage of 70 V, skimmer voltage of 14 V for positive and negative mode with changed polarity. The high mass range measurements were conducted with a capillary voltage of 55 V and -45 V, tube lens voltage of 115 V and -105 V, skimmer voltage of 22 V and -24 V for positive and negative mode respectively.</br>
</p>
The MS2 analysis was performed with a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For fragmentation experiments an S-lens RF level of 50, a sprayer voltage of 3.5 kV and capillary and heater temperature of 350 °C were chosen. A sheath gas flow of 50 and aux gas of 15 for positive ESI-mode and 40 and 10 for negative mode, respectively, were employed. In SIM mode (m/z 100-1000) the resolution was set to 70,000, for the data dependent fragmentation a resolution of 17,500 was chosen. In both cases the AGC target was 1 x 10^6 and the maximum injection time was set to 25 ms. The quadrupole isolation window was 1 m/z and a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 25 arbitrary units was used. The data depended fragmentation settings were an underfill ratio of 0.1% resulting in an intensity threshold for fragmentation of 4 x 10^4, the apex trigger was set from 2-5  s and molecules charged higher than 3 were excluded."	"The raw data was converted to mzML using msconvert. Centroiding, metabolic feature detection and linking were performed using OpenMS. A feature consists of all peaks that belong to the same metabolite with a certain charge state and adduct. Features were identified separately for each sample; matching features are then linked across all samples. Feature intensities were normalized by a pairwise comparison between each sample and the sample with the most features. For each pairwise comparison we computed the average intensity ratio and multiplied all feature intensities in the respective map by the inverse."	"Identification is based on matching the accurate masses against the theoretical mass of databases like HMDB or METLIN. Putative identifications were confirmed with tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) and retention time matching using a reference standard."
