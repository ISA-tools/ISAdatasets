Study Title	"Mining for metabolic responses to long-term salt stress: a case study on the model legume Lotus japonicus (A)"
Study Description	"Translational genomics, the use of model species to generate knowledge about biological processes and the functions of genes, offers great promise to biotechnologists. Few studies have sought robust responses of model plants to environmental stresses, such as salinity, by altering the stress dosage or by repeating experiments in consecutive years and/or different seasons.We mined our published and unpublished data on legume salt acclimation for robust system features at the ionomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic levels. We analysed data from the model legume Lotus japonicus, obtained through six independent, longterm, non-lethal salt stress experiments which were carried out over two consecutive years. Best possible controlled greenhouse conditions were applied and two main questions asked: how reproducible are results obtained from physiologically meaningful salinity experiments, and what degree of bias may be expected if conclusions are drawn from less well-repeated sampling. A surprisingly large fraction of the transcriptional and metabolic responses to salt stress were not reproducible between experiments. A core set of robust changes was found that was shared between experiments. Many of these robust responses were qualitatively and quantitatively conserved between different accessions of the same species, indicating that the robust responses may be a sound starting point for translational genomics."

Study Protocol Description	"Seeds of Lotus japonicus var. Gifu were germinated on agar plates containing agarified half-strength BD solution [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. Four days after imbibition, seedlings were transplanted to soil (Einheit, type null) in 10 cm pots, and irrigated with the above solution. Two salt-stress treatments were implemented: (i) gradual step acclimation to various final NaCl concentrations, or (ii) initial acclimation growth at various NaCl concentrations. The gradual acclimation started 8 days post-imbibition, and the salt concentration was increased in three steps of 4 days from 0 to 50, 100 and 150 mm NaCl. A subset of plants was kept at each salt level. Initial acclimation growth exposed plants from germination onwards to nutrient solution supplemented with 25, 50 and 75 mm NaCl. In both cases, fresh nutrient solution was prepared every 4 days. The total duration of greenhouse culture was 28 days under a 16/8 h day/night regime, 23 ± 2°C, 55–65% relative humidity. Whole shoots, excluding cotyledons, were sampled in situ into liquid nitrogen in the middle of the light period. Three successive independent experiments (experiments 1, 2 and 3) were performed during the spring season. Each experiment consisted of seven sample sets: control (no salts), 50, 100, 150 (gradual step acclimatization), ia25, ia50 and ia75 (initial acclimatization). Each set had seven independent biological replicate pools of four plants, with the exception of ia75 treatment in experiments 2 and 3 where fewer replicates were available (five and four, respectively). The stress doses used in the experimental designs were not lethal within the cultivation period, and at harvest all plants were in the vegetative stage, and roots did not show nodules. Growth was estimated by determination of mean fresh weight of the pooled shoots, and soil electrical conductivity was determined on 1:2 dried soil:water extraction.

"Metabolites were identified using NIST05 software (http://www.nist.gov/srd/mslist.htm) and the mass spectral and retention time index (RI) collection of the Golm metabolome database [1][2]. Mass spectral matching was manually checked, and accepted with thresholds of match >650 (maximum 1000) and RI < 1.0 %. RIs represent Kovàts indices [3] calculated from additions of C12, C15, C19, C22, C32, C36n-alkanes. Table S4 lists not only metabolites identified by standard addition but also mass spectral tags that are as yet unidentified [4].
