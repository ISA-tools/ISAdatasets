Study Title	"Untangling the wine metabolome by combining untargeted SMPE-GCxGC-TOF-MS and sensory analysis to profile Sauvignon blanc co-fermented with seven different yeasts"
Study Description	"Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) is the main driver of alcoholic fermentation however for aroma and flavour formation in wine non-Saccharomyces species can have a powerful effect. This study aimed to compare untargeted volatile compound profiles from SPME-GCxGC-TOF-MS and sensory analysis data of Sauvignon blanc wine inoculated with six different non-Saccharomyces yeasts followed by SC. Torulaspora delbrueckii (TD), Lachancea thermotolerans (LT), Pichia kluyveri (PK) and Metschnikowia pulcherrima (MP) where commercial starter strains, while Candida zemplinina (CZ) and Kazachstania aerobia (KA), were isolated from wine grape environments. Each fermentation produced a distinct profile both sensorially and chemically. SC and CZ were the most distinct in both of these cases. SC had guava, grapefruit, banana, and pineapple aromas while CZ was driven by fermented apple, dried peach/apricot, and stewed fruit as well as sour flavor. Chemically over 300 unique features were identified as significantly different across the fermentations. SC had the highest number of esters in the highest relative concentration but all the yeasts had distinct ester profiles. CZ displayed the highest number of terpenes in high concentration but also produced a large amount of acetic acid. KA was high in ethyl acetate. TD had fewer esters but three distinctly higher thiol compounds. LT showed a relatively high number of increased acetate esters and certain terpenes. PK had some off odor compounds while the MP had high levels of different methyl butyl-, methyl propyl-, and phenethyl esters. Overall, this study gives a more detailed profile of these yeasts than anything previously reported."

Study Protocol Description	"Sauvignon blanc grapes (vintage 2014) were obtained from the vineyards at Welgevallen Experimental Farm, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa. S. cerevisiae (Enoferm M2®, Lallemand Inc., Quebec, Canada), T. delbrueckii (Biodiva®, Lallemand Inc., Quebec, Canada), M. pulcherrima (Flavia®, Lallemand Inc., Quebec, Canada), P. kluyveri (Viniflora® FROOTZEN™, Chr. Hansen, Horsholm, Denmark), L. thermotolerans (Viniflora® CONCERTO™, Chr. Hansen, Horsholm, Denmark), C. zemplinina (Institute of Wine Biotechnology (IWBT)-Y1082) and K. aerobia (IWBT-Y845) were used to ferment the grape must. 11 l stainless steel fermentation vessels containing 10 l of must were inoculated with 10^6 cfu/ml of yeast. Fermentations were carried out in triplicate at 15 °C. The non-Saccharomyces yeasts were allowed to ferment until approximately 2% ethanol concentration was reached. At this point, S. cerevisiae was added at 10^6 cfu/mL concentration to finish the fermentations. The final wines were bottled after clarification via cold rest for one week at -4 °C in 750 ml glass bottles with screw caps. Wines were then transported to the laboratory of the Department of Food Quality and Nutrition, Research and Innovation Center, Fondazione Edmund Mach (FEM) for chemical analysis."	"A divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) coating 50/30 μm, 2 cm length Solid-Phase-Micro-Extraction (SPME) fibre was used for wine volatile extraction. Vials were prepared as follows. 5 ml of wine and 50 μl of 0.5 mg/l 2-octanol were added to 20 ml screw cap vials containing 1.5 g NaCl. A Gerstel MPS autosampler (GERSTEL GmbH & Co. KG) equipped with the standard sample agitator and a SPME fibre conditioning station was used to extract the volatiles from the sample vial headspace. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 35 °C under 500 rpm rotation at 10 s intervals. Extraction took place at 10 s, 5 min, and 30 min, prior to desorption in the inlet for 180 s at 250 °C. Quality control (QC) vials consisting of an equal mix of all samples were spaced at the beginning and every third sample thereafter."	"GC×GC-TOF-MS analysis of the extracts was performed using a LECO Pegasus-4D system consisting of an Agilent 6890N (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a LECO Pegasus 4D detector. The system employed a consumables free modulation system. Helium carrier gas was used with a flow set at 1.2 mL/min and a splitless time of 180sec. The oven was equipped with a 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm VF-WAX MS primary column (Agilent Technologies) and a 1.5 m x 0.15 mm x 0.15 μm RXI 17Sil MS secondary column (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA). The GC oven parameters were as follows: initial temperature was 40 °C held for 2 min, followed by an increase to 250 °C at a rate of 6 °C/min, the oven was then held at 250 °C for 5 min before returning to the initial temperature (40 °C). The total cycle time, was 42 min. The modulation period was set to 7 s with a hot pulse time of 1.4 s. The modulator was offset by 15 °C. "	"The MS protocol consisted of electron ionization at 70 eV with ion source temperature at 230 °C, a detector voltage of 1543 V with a voltage offset of 200 V, mass range of m/z 35-350, and acquisition rate of 200 spectra per second. There was an acquisition delay of 120 s."	"ChromaTOF software version 4.32 was used to perform baseline correction, deconvolution and peak picking of the raw data. The baseline offset was set to 1, just above the noise level. The first dimension peak width was set to 43 s while the second dimension peak width was set to 0.1 s. A factor of 500 was set as the match required to combine peaks in the second dimension. A signal to noise (S/N) of 10 was used for the 10 s and 5 min extraction times data with a minimum S/N of 6 for sub peak retention. A S/N of 100 was used for the 30 min extraction time data with a minimum S/N of 60 for sub peak retention. Traditional integration was used. Forward library searching was used with the following parameters: Hits to return were set to 10, minimum molecular weight was set to 40, maximum molecular weight was set to 350, the mass threshold was set to 50 and the minimum similarity match was set to 700. The NIST and Wiley libraries were used. For alignment the following parameters were used: a mass threshold of 10, a minimum similarity match of 600, the maximum number of modulation periods matching peaks could be apart was set to 1, a maximum retention time difference was set to 7 s, for peaks not found by initial peak finding the signal to noise ratio was set to 5 for the 10 s and 5 min extractions and to 50 for the 30 min extractions, for analytes to be kept they had to be found in all biological replicates within a class. Each yeast species was given its own class."	"Metabolite identification was preformed using spectral matching to the NIST and Wiley libraries. In the retention time column we report both the first and second dimention time separated by a comma (eg. 1D, 2D)."
