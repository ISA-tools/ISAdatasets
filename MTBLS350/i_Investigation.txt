Study Identifier	"MTBLS350"
Study Title	"An Integrated Biochemical, Proteomics, and Metabolomics Approach for Supporting Medicinal Value of Panax ginseng Fruits (GC-MS assay)."
Study Description	"Panax ginseng roots are well known for their medicinal properties and have been used in Korean and Chinese traditional medicines for 1000s of years. However, the medicinal value of P. ginseng fruits remain poorly characterized. Using gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS), 66 metabolites including amino acids, sugars, organic acids, phenolic acids, phytosterols, tocopherols, and policosanols were identified and quantified. Some of these are well known medicinal compounds and were not previously identified in ginseng. Interestingly, the concentration of almost all metabolites was higher in the Chunpoong and Gumpoong cultivars. Parallel comparison of the four cultivars also revealed higher amounts of the medicinal metabolites in Chunpoong and Gumpoong cultivars. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ginseng fruits are a rich source of medicinal compounds with potential beneficial health effects."

Study Protocol Description	"In this study, four P. ginseng cultivars were used. These are: (i) Yunpoong with violet stem and red fruits, (ii) Gumpoong with green stem and yellow fruits, (iii) Chunpoong with majorly green stem and orange fruits, and (iv) Cheongsun with green stem and red fruits. Each cultivar grown in the greenhouse (average temperature 22.5 ± 2.5 °C, humidity 50 ± 10%) at the National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science, Rural Development Administration (RDA) at Eumseong-gun, South Korea (36 °N, 127 °E). Four years into its growing season, in the month of July, the roots, leaves, and fruits were harvested, powdered using liquid nitrogen and stored in a deep freezer (-80 °C) until further processing."	"All analyses were performed, at least, in triplicate.
</p>
Hydrophilic metabolites:</br>
Hydrophilic metabolites were extracted from the powdered fruit sample (10 mg) by addition of 1 ml of 2.5:1:1 (v/v/v) methanol:water:chloroform. Ribitol (60 µl, 0.2 mg/ml, J. T. Baker, USA) was used an as internal standard (IS). Extraction was performed at 37 °C with a mixing frequency of 1200 rpm for 30 min, using a thermomixer compact (Eppendorf AG, Germany). The solutions were then centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 3 min. The polar phase (0.8 ml) was transferred into a new tube, and 0.4 ml of water was added. The mixed contents of the tube were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 3 min. The methanol/water phase was dried in a centrifugal concentrator (CVE-2000, Eyela, Japan) for 2 h, followed by a drying process in a freeze dryer for 16 h. Methoxime (MO)-derivatization was performed by adding 80 μl of methoxyamine hydrochloride (20 mg/ml, Thermo, USA) in pyridine and shaking at 30 °C for 90 min. Trimethylsilyl (TMS) etherification was performed by adding 80 μl of MSTFA (N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide, Sigma, MO) at 37 °C for 30 min.
</p>
Lipophilic metabolites:</br>
Lipophilic metabolites were extracted from the powdered fruit sample (50 mg) by addition of 3 ml of ethanol containing 0.1% ascorbic acid (w/v). 5α-cholestane (50 µl, 10 µg/ml) was used an as internal standard (IS), mixed by vortexing for 20 s, and placed in a water bath at 85°C for 5 min. After removal from the water bath, 120 µl of potassium hydroxide (80%, w/v) was added, and the samples were vortexed for 20 s and returned to the water bath for 10 min. After saponification, samples were immediately placed on ice, and deionized water (1.5 ml) was added. Hexane (1.5 ml) was then added to each sample and vortexed for 20 s, followed by centrifugation (1200 x g, 5 min). The upper layer was pipetted into a separate tube, and the pellet was re-extracted using hexane. The hexane fraction was dried in a centrifugal concentrator (CVE-2000; Eyela, Tokyo, Japan). For derivatization, 30 µl of MSTFA with 30 µl of pyridine was added and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min at a mixing frequency of 1200 rpm using a thermomixer comfort (model 5355; Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany)."	"Hydrophilic metabolites:</br>
Gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) was performed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent, Atlanta, GA, USA) coupled to a Pegasus HT TOF mass spectrometer (LECO, St. Joseph, MI). A derivatized sample (1 μl) was separated on a 30 m x 0.25 mm I.D. fused-silica capillary column coated with 0.25 μm CP-SIL 8 CB low bleed (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). The helium gas flow rate through the column was 1.0 ml/min. The injector temperature was 230 °C, and the split ratio was set at 1:25. The temperature program was as follows: Initial temperature 80 °C for 2 min, followed by an increase to 320 °C at 15 °C/min, and a 10 min hold at 320 °C.

GC-TOFMS was performed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent, Atlanta, GA, USA) coupled to a Pegasus HT TOF mass spectrometer (LECO, St. Joseph, MI). The transfer line and ion-source temperatures were 250 and 200 °C, respectively. The scanned mass range was 85–600 m/z, and the detector voltage was set at 1700 V.

"ChromaTOF software (version 4.34; LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) was used to process the data."	"ChromaTOF software (version 4.34; LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) was used to support peak findings prior to quantitative analysis and for automated deconvolution of reference mass spectra. The NIST (version 2.1.2.0, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and in-house libraries for standard chemicals were utilized for identification of the compounds. Quantitative calculations of the concentrations of all analytes were based on the peak area ratios for each relative to the peak area of the IS."
