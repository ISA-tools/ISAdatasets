STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS385"
Study Title	"Desorption electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry imaging of esophageal lymph mode metastases"
Study Description	"Lymph node metastases (LNM) and primary tumour samples were analysed using desorption electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (DESI MSI). Current assessment of LNM depends on subjective histopathological assessment, whereas analysis by DESI MSI permits an entirely objective assessment. The mass spectral data revealed specific lipidomic patterns across samples, which were shown to correspond to the immunohistochemical image. Statistical prediction of LNM samples was performed using the esophageal adenocarcinoma samples with sensitivity and specificity of 89.5% and 100%, respectively."

Study Protocol Description	"Tissue speciments were removed during surgical interventions and were fresh-frozen immediately at -196 °C. Samples were stored at -80 °C prior to further processing."	"Frozen tissue sections were cut at a thickness of 15 µm, and were mounted onto glass slides."	"For DESI analysis, tissue sections were brought to room temperature. DESI MSI was carried out using a home-built DESI ion source coupled to a high-resolution orbital trapping mass spectrometer (Exactive, Thermo Scientifc GmbH). The DESI ion source was operated at a spatial resolution of 75 µm using nitrogen pressure of 7 bar, high voltage of 5 kV, a solvent mixture of methanol and water in a ratio 90:10 and a flow rate of 1.5 µl/min. The mass analysis was carried out in negative ion mode in the mass range m/z = 150–1,000 at a nominal mass resolution of 100,000 at m/z = 200 and a mass accuracy of ± 2 ppm.  Further experimental parameters can be found in the associated journal articles."	"After DESI imaging, the LNM tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) followed by the anti-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 antibody. The primary tumour samples were only stained with H&E."	"Raw mass spectrometric data was converted to imzML format via imzML Converter (version 1.0.5) and imported into MATLAB (R2014a) for feature extraction, pre-processing and data analysis."	"Metabolite identification was not performed."
