Study Title	"Fragmentation patterns of methyloxime-trimethylsilyl derivatives of constitutive mono- and disaccharide isomers analyzed by gas chromatography/field ionization mass spectrometry."
Study Description	"In saccharide analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), electron ionization (EI) is used almost exclusively, whereas other gentler methods of ionization are rarely used. Field ionization (FI) is recognized as a GC/MS ionization method that causes fewer fragment ions, but only few studies are available on its use in saccharide analysis. To evaluate the usefulness of FI in profiling isomeric saccharides by GC/MS and to explore its potential application in metabolome analysis, we compared EI, chemical ionization (CI), and FI spectral patterns of consecutive mono- and disaccharides derivatized with methoxamine-HCl and N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. FI produced molecular ions and fragment ions characteristic of constitutive isomeric disaccharides. All of the derivatized saccharides that originally had free anomeric OH showed methyloxime-moiety fragment ions, attributable to the cleavage between C2 and C3. Some fragment ions in FI were indicative of the position of dihexose linkages. Although EI with lowered voltage (18 V, 130 °C) produced fewer fragment ions than conventional EI (70 V, 250 °C) did, fragmentation patterns were different from those of FI. Our data show that FI is useful for distinguishing isomeric saccharides in qualitative analyses."

Study Protocol Description	"Standard samples were dissolved into MilliQ water (Millipore Co., Billerica, MA, USA) and aliquoted (50 µg mono- or di-saccharide in 100 µl MilliQ water)."	"The dried aliquot by vacuum concentrator (Iwaki, Asahi techno glass) was incubated with 20 µl methoxamine-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich; M6524) solution (20 mg methoxamine-HCl in 500 µl pyridine) for 90 min at room temperature (approximately 25 °C). Then, 80 µl N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA; Sigma-Aldrich; 394866) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C."	"GC/MS measurements were carried out on a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (AccuTOF GCv 4G; JEOL, Akishima, Japan) equipped with a 7890A GC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Typical column, injector settings, and temperature programs were as follows. The injection volume was 1 µl (splitless) in EI mode. In FI mode, 2 µl was injected using splitless mode unless otherwise stated. The injector temperature was set at 230 °C. GC separation was performed on a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies) with a carrier gas (He) flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The oven temperature gradient for the derivatized standard saccharides was as follows. After a 4 min, 70 °C isotherm period, the oven was programmed to rise to 325 °C at a rate of 35 °C/min, then held at 325 °C for 1 min. The temperature of the GC/MS transfer line was set at 250 °C."	"An EI/FI combination ion source was used with the JEOL AccuTOF GCv 4G GC/oaTOFMS system, which has been partially updated from the prototype described previously in [1] The ion source temperature was set at a value in the range of 130–250 °C for EI, and 70–220 °C for FI. Unless otherwise stated, EI voltage and current were 70 V with 300 µA and 18 V with 100 µA, respectively. For FI measurements, carbon emitters purchased from CARBOTEC (Bonn, Germany) were used; the emitter (CARBOTEC FI) consists of a 5 µm tungsten wire with a carbon microneedle coating, max current on which is 11.5 mA. Cathode voltage for FI was set at –l0 kV. The emitter was refreshed with a 10 mA flush current for 30 ms in every 400 ms spectral data acquisition cycle as described previously [1]. Each emitter could be used for 80 repeated injections, at least, without any visible sign of degradation in spectral patterns or increased background signals. The recording m/z range was 10–1600 in all ionization modes. Typical pressures in the ion source and mass analyzer were on the order of 10–4 Pa and 10–5 Pa, respectively, for both EI and FI modes. The micro-channel plate detector voltage was set at 1700 V for regular EI mode, 2100 V for low-voltage (18 V) EI mode, and 2100 V for FI mode. The detector gain differences (peak intensity enhancement) between each voltage setting were 12.7 times (from 1700 V to 1850 V) and 125 times (from 1700 V to 2100 V), respectively."	"Data was processed using JEOL Mass Center (version: V2.6.2b)."	"To evaluate the reproducibility of the derivatization procedure and sensitivity of each ionization mode, glucose standard solutions were aliquoted and dried down in microtubes to make test samples that contain 5 nmol, 10 nmol, 50 nmol, 100 nmol, 500 nmol, 1 µmol, 5 µmol, 10 µmol, and 50 µmol of glucose per tube (three tubes each). The test samples were derivatized by using the above-mentioned protocol, and 1 µl (out of 100 µl) from each tube was subjected to GC/MS analysis with each ionization mode. The peak areas (N = 3 for each concentration) of conventional EI-mode extracted ion chromatogram (EIC, m/z 319.2) showed good linearity (R2 = 0.9991) in sample concentrations from 50 pmol/µl (the lowest concentration tested) to 5 nmol/µl (the highest concentration that gave no detector saturation). The peak areas of FI-mode EIC (m/z 569.3) showed good linearity (R2 = 0.9987) from 5 nmol/µl (the lowest concentration that gave good signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)) up to 100 nmol/µl (linearity lost above this concentration)."
