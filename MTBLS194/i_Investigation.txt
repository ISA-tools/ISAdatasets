Study Title	"Matrix Effect on Chemical Isotope Labeling and Its Implication in Metabolomic Sample Preparation for Quantitative Metabolomics"
Study Description	"Matrix effect from various constituents in biological samples can reduce the accuracy of quantitative metabolomics. Differential chemical isotope labeling liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (CIL LC-MS) can overcome the matrix effect on MS detection based on measuring the intensity ratios of metabolite peak pairs detected in a mixture of a light-isotope labeled sample and a heavy-isotope labeled reference sample. However, the chemical labeling process itself may encounter matrix effect which can influence the overall quantitative results. In this work, we report the effects of salts and buffers commonly present in metabolomic samples on dansylation labeling. It is shown that high concentrations of NaCl and phosphate buffer (>50 mM) or PBS can reduce or enhance the labeling efficiencies of metabolites. By maintaining similar matrix contents in an individual sample vs. a reference sample, relative quantification of metabolites can be performed without compromising the metabolomic profiling results. For samples containing varying amounts of high salts such as urine, we demonstrate that the matrix effect can be largely overcome by diluting the original sample before dansylation labeling (e.g., 4-fold dilution for urine)."

Study Protocol Description	"Urine samples were collected from five age-matched healthy mice. Equal volumes of the five individual samples were mixed together to make a pooled sample. After sample collection, the urine samples were immediatelystored in -80 °C freezer for further use."	"The frozen urine samples were thawed in an ice-bath and then centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min. 12.5 µl supernatant was taken into an Eppendorf tube and totally dried using a Speed Vac. The sample was re-dissolved to 50 µL with water or a specific matrix solution. Then 25 µl of 250 mM sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate buffer and 25 µl of ACN were added into the sample. The solution was vortexed, spun down, and mixed with 50 µL of freshly prepared 12C-dansyl chloride solution (18 mg/ml) (for light labeling) or 13C-dansyl chloride solution (18 mg/ml) (for heavy labeling). After 45 min incubation at 40 °C, 10 µl of 250 mM NaOH was added to the reaction mixture to quench the excess dansyl chloride. The solution was then incubated at 40 °C for another 10 min. Finally, formic acid in 50/50 ACN/H2O was added to consume excess NaOH and to make the solution acidic. The 12C- or 13C-labeled sample was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 10 min before injecting onto the ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) column for UV quantification (see below). For LC-MS analysis, the 12C- and 13C-labeled samples were mixed in equal amounts based on the quantification results."	"An Agilent 1100 series binary system (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) and an Agilent reversed-phase Eclipse plus C18 column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.8 µm particle size, 95 Å pore size) were used for LC-MS. LC solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in 5% (v/v) ACN, and solvent B was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile. The gradient elution profile was as follows: t = 0 min, 20% B; t = 3.5 min, 35% B; t = 18.0 min, 65% B; t = 24.0 min, 99% B; t = 32.0 min, 99% B. The flow rate was 180 µl/min."	"The flow from HPLC was split 1:2 and a 60 µl/min flow was loaded to the electrospray ionization (ESI) source of a Bruker 9.4 Tesla Apex-Qe Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA), while the rest of the flow was delivered to waste. All MS spectra were obtained in the positive ion mode. To monitor the instrumental performance, a quality control sample (i.e., a differentially labeled urine sample) was injected every 10–12 sample injections."	"The 12C/13C peak pairs were extracted by the IsoMS software reported [1]. IsoMS-Align was used to align the peak pair data from different samples by retention time and accurate mass [1]. The missing values were filled back by using the Zero-fill program [2]. Multivariate statistical analysis was carried out using SIMCA-P+ 12 (Umetrics AB, Umea, Sweden).
