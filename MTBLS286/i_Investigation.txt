STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS286"
Study Title	"Identification of Conserved and Diverse Metabolic Shifts during Rice Grain Development (LC-MS pos assay)"
Study Description	"Here we investigated the dynamic metabolic changes along the rice grain development of two japonica and two indica cultivars using non-targeted metabolomics approach, in which we successfully identified 214 metabolites. Principal component and clustering analysis revealed both cultivar and developmental stage dependent metabolic changes in rice grains. Generally, the stage specific metabolic kinetics corresponded well to the physiological status of the developing grains, and some of metabolic changes in developing grain of monocot rice are common with those of dicot Arabidopsis and tomato, while others show rice specific patterns. </p> See MTBLS287 and MYTBLS288 for the LC-MS neg and GC-MS assays respectively for this study."

Study Protocol Description	"Rice plants were planted in a paddy filed in Minghang (31.03 °N, 121.45 °E), Shanghai, China, during the summer season in 2013. Four biological replications of rice seeds at 7, 10, 14, 28 and 42 DAF were collected, immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen, lyophilized for 48 hours and stored at -80 °C until metabolomics analysis."	"Put 20 mg fine powder of rice grain in 2 ml Eppendorf tube and add one zirconia ball to every tube. Add 500 µl 80% MeOH and homogenize with the Retsch Muhle, 3 min at 25 Hz. Centrifuge 10 min at 14000 rpm. Take 450 µl supernatant into a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge 10 min at 14000 rpm. Take 350 µl supernatant into a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube."	"LC analysis was performed on the Aglient 1290 Infinity II LCTM system. Samples were injected into an Agilent Eclipse-plus C18 column (150 x 3.0 mm i.d., 1.8 µm), and the column temperature was set at 40 °C. The mobile phase consisted of A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (100% acetonitrile). The gradient conditions of the mobile phase as follows: 0 min, 98.0% A; 1.0 min, 98% A; 5.0 min, 60% A; 12.0 min, 30% A; 15.0 min, 5% A; 20.0 min, 5% A. The flow rate was 0.40 ml/min. The sample injection volume was 1.00 µl."	"MS detection was performed on a Agilent 6550 iFunnel/Q-TOF mass spectrometer with Agilent Jet-Stream source. Full scan mass spectra were recorded through a range of 50-1000 m/z with scan rate at 2 spectra/s. The ESI source was operated in positive and negative ionization modes with a capillary voltage of 3.5 kV for both modes, nozzle voltage at 250V (+) and 1500V (-), fragmentor voltage of 380 V, nebulizer was 25 psi, sheath gas and dry gas were set at the flow rate of 12 l/min and 16 l/min, respectively, and CID voltage applied with 10 V, 20 V and 40 V."	"Data acquisition, review, alignment and normalization were performed with the softwares of MassHunter Acquisition 6.0, MassHunter Qualitative 6.0, Mass Profinder 6.0 and Mass Profiler Professional 13.0 (MPP 13.0)."	"Metabolites were annotated by searching Personal Compound Database and Library (PCD/PCDL), Metlin database [1], Massbank database [2] and literatures [3][4][5]. Based on accurate MS, MS/MS spectrum, and/or retention time.
