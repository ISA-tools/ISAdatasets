Study Title	"Collected tandem mass spectrometry data on monoterpene indole alkaloids from natural product chemistry research"
Study Description	"MIADB: a cumulative collection of 172 tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of a vast array of monoterpene indole alkaloids. Samples were analyzed using an Agilent LC-MS system composed of an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC coupled to an Agilent 6530 ESI-Q-TOF-MS operating in positive mode. A Sunfire analytical C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm; i.d. 3.5 μm, Waters) was used, with a flow rate of 250 μL/min and a linear gradient from 5% B (A: H2O + 0.1% formic acid, B: MeOH) to 100% B over 30 min. ESI conditions were set with the capillary temperature at 320 °C, source voltage at 3.5 kV, and a sheath gas flow rate of 10 L/min. The divert valve was set to waste for the first 3 min. There were four scan events: positive MS, window from m/z 100−1200, then three data-dependent MS/MS scans of the first, second, and third most intense ions from the first scan event. MS/MS settings were three fixed collision energies (30, 50, and 70 eV), default charge of 1, minimum intensity of 5000 counts, and isolation width of m/z 2. In the positive-ion mode, purine C5H4N4 [M + H]+ ion (m/z 121.050873) and the hexakis(1H,1H,3H-tetrafluoropropoxy)-phosphazene C18H18F24N3O6P3 [M + H]+ ion (m/z 922.009 798) were used as internal lock masses. Full scans were acquired at a resolution of 11 000 (at m/z 922). A permanent MS/MS exclusion list criterion was set to prevent oversampling of the internal calibrant."

Study Protocol Description	"Each of the collected MIAs was diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml using HPLC-gradient MeOH as solvent. The solution was then put in 1.5 ml HPLC vials and analyzed by MS/MS. Chemicals and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 500 µl, 1 mg/ml MeOH."	"No extraction was carried out in this study."	"Samples were analyzed using an Agilent LC-MS system composed of an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC. A Sunfire analytical C18 column (150 x 2.1 mm; i.d. 3.5 μm, Waters) was used, with a flow rate of 250 μl/min and a linear gradient from 5% B (A: H2O + 0.1% formic acid, B: MeOH) to 100% B over 30 min."

Full scans were acquired at a resolution of 11,000 (at m/z 922). A permanent MS/MS exclusion list criterion was set to prevent oversampling of the internal calibrant."	"The .d files were converted to .mgf using MassHunter. An average MS/MS spectrum was generated from the spectra obtained at 30, 50 and 70 eV collision energies."	"This study was set to provide standard MS/MS spectra of a library of natural product molecules. As such no metabolite identification work was carried out in this study."
