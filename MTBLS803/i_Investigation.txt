Study Title	"The unique composition of Indian gut microbiome, gene catalogue and associated faecal metabolome deciphered using multi-omics approaches"
Study Description	"BACKGROUND: Metagenomic studies carried out in the past decade have led to an enhanced understanding of the gut microbiome in human health, however, the Indian gut microbiome is not well explored yet. We analysed the gut microbiome of 110 healthy individuals from two distinct locations (North-Central and Southern) in India using multi-omics approaches, including 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, whole genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomic profiling of faecal and serum samples. </br> RESULTS: The gene catalogue established in this study emphasizes the uniqueness of the Indian gut microbiome in comparison to other populations. The gut microbiome of the cohort from North-Central India, which was primarily consuming a plant-based diet, was found to be associated with Prevotella, and also showed an enrichment of Branched Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis pathways. In contrast, the gut microbiome of the cohort from Southern India, which was consuming an omnivorous diet, showed associations with Bacteroides, Ruminococcus and Faecalibacterium, and had an enrichment of Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) biosynthesis pathway and BCAA transporters. This corroborated well with the metabolomics results, which showed higher concentration of BCAAs in the serum metabolome of the North-Central cohort and an association with Prevotella. In contrast, the concentration of BCAAs were found higher in the faecal metabolome of the Southern-India cohort, and showed a positive correlation with the higher abundance of BCAA transporters. </br> CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals the unique composition of Indian gut microbiome, establishes the Indian gut microbial gene catalogue, and compares it with the gut microbiome of other populations. The functional associations revealed using metagenomic and metabolomic approaches provide novel insights on the gut-microbe-metabolic axis, which will be useful for future epidemiological and translational researches."

Study Protocol Description	"The faecal samples and blood samples were collected from healthy participants for faecal and serum metabolomic anaysis. Each faecal sample was frozen within 30 min of collection. The serum samples were stored and processed immediately after collection."	"Lyophilized faecal samples were used to achieve better metabolite coverage. Metabolites were extracted with 1 ml of ice-cold methanol: water (8:2) from 80 mg of lyophilized samples in a bath ultrasonicator (Bioruptor TM UCD-200, Diagenode, USA) at 4 °C for 30 min followed by 2 min of vortexing. The supernatant was extracted by centrifugation at 18,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C and dried at 50 °C under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. To remove the residual water molecules from the samples, 100 µl of toluene was added to the dry residue and evaporated completely at 50 °C under nitrogen gas. Dry extracted metabolites were first derivatized with 50 µl of methoxyamine hydrochloride (MOX) in pyridine (20 mg/ml) at 60 °C for 2 hr, and the second derivatization was performed with 100 µl of MSTFA in 1% TMCS at 60 °C for 45 min to form trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. Finally, 150 µl of the TMS derivatives was transferred into a GC glass vial inserts and subjected to GC-MS analysis."	"GC-MS was performed on an in-house Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph with 5975C MS system. An HP-5 (25 m × 320 µm × 0.25 um i.d.) fused silica capillary column (Agilent J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) was used with the open split interface."	"The derivatized sample was injected (3 ml) at split ratio of 10 into Agilent 7890A. The injector, transfer line and ion source temperatures were maintained at 220, 220 and 250 °C, respectively. Oven temperature was programmed at 70 °C for 0.2 min, and increased at 10 °C/min to 270 °C where it was sustained for 5 min, and further increased at 40 °C/min to 310 °C where it was held for 11 min. The MS was operated in the electron impact ionization mode at 70 eV. Mass data were acquired in full scan mode from m/z 40 to 600 with an acquisition rate of 20 spectra/s."	"No raw data was converted to other formats in this study."	"Identification of metabolites was based on retention time and m/z values."
