Study Title	"Isotopomer analysis of MCF-7 breast cancer cell line incubated with 13C labelled glucose (GC-MS assay)"
Study Description	"MS and NMR are two of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques used in the field of fluxomics, to analyze the flux distributions in cellular metabolomic pathways. Both of them possess pros and cons, such as, MS being the most sensitive and low-cost technique, while needs extensive sample processing and providing incomplete labeling data, whereas NMR needs lesser sample preparation and provides more detailed labeling data, while being less sensitive and expensive. Since both techniques could be viewed as complementary to each other, combining their data could yield a detailed and complete information about a system under study. In this case, samples were generated from a single experiment and the same set of samples was used both in MS and 1D NMR to analyze the 13C label distributions in TCA cycle intermediates. The data generated from both methods were used with a simulation script that was developed to integrate the MS and NMR data. MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was used as an experimental model and it was incubated with 100% [1,2-13C]-glucose and 100% [U-13C]-glucose for 8 hours. The cells, before and after incubation with tracers, were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then later processed for extracting the TCA cycle intermediates. Same set of samples were separated for GC-MS and NMR based analysis and processed for the respective techniques. The isotopologue analysis was performed by GC-MS and the isotopomer analysis was performed by NMR and both sets of data were integrated with the simulation software. This study contains the data for GC-MS analysis.

Study Protocol Description	"MCF-7 cells were seeded (1,000,000 per p100 plate) and 6 ml of medium was used in each of them. In total 48 plates were seeded - 6 plates combined together for each replicate (as 1:5 ratio for GCMS:NMR). The medium used was basal medium DMEM (A14430, Invitrogen) with 10% dialyzed FBS (F0392, Sigma), 0.01 mg/ml Insulin (19278, Sigma), 1% Non-Essential Amino acids (01-340-1B, Biological Industries), 10 mM glucose (G8769, Sigma) and 4 mM Glutamine (25030-81, Life Technologies).
</p>
After 48 h of cell seeding, media was removed and plates were washed twice with PBS. 6 ml of fresh media containing tracers were added to each plate. The conditions used in this experiment were cold natural samples with [U-12C]-glucose (unlabeled glucose) (A), samples with tracer [U-13C6]-glucose (B) and samples with tracer [1,2-13C2]-glucose (C), amounting to 10 mM of glucose in each case. Time points of 0 h (before adding tracer) and 8 h (after tracers incubation) were maintained. 3 replicates for each condition at 8 h of tracers incubation (B and C) and 1 replicate for cold natural (A) at 8 h were obtained. In addition 3 plates were used for 0 h cell counting and another 3 for 8 h cell counting. 
</p>
After 8 h incubation, medium was removed and kept for biochemical concentration analysis. Plates were washed twice with cold PBS followed by snap-freezing using liquid nitrogen. Plates were kept under -80 ºC until their analysis.
</p>
The commercial glucose standard mixture used for validation consisted of 10 mM with the composition of [U-12C]-D-glucose (82%) + [1,2-13C]-D-glucose (10%) + [1-13C]-D-glucose (3%) + [1,6-13C]-D-glucose (5%)."	"6 plates of a same condition were combined together for each replicate. Plates were processed in the following way. 1 ml of cold methanol (100% v/v) was added to one plate. 1 min later 1 ml of cold water was added to the same plate. The content of the plate was scraped and all the content was transferred to a second plate. The content of this plate was scraped and was transferred to a third plate. This process was followed with the 6 plates of the same replicate. After scraping the 6th plate, all the content was transferred to a glass tube, where 2 ml of cold chloroform was added. Tubes were vigorously agitated for 30 min at 4 ºC. After agitation, 1/6 part of the content of the tube was transferred to a separate tube. The tube containing the 1/6 part was used for GC/MS analysis and the tube containing the 5/6 part was used for NMR analysis.
</p>
Next, tubes were centrifuged and the upper phase containing the polar metabolites was transferred to a separate glass tube. The tubes containing the polar phase for GCMS analysis were immediately evaporated to dryness under airflow at room temperature.
</p>
The intracellular polar metabolites were derivatized by adding 50 µl 2% (v/v) methoxamine hydrochloride in pyridine and shaken vigorously at 37 °C for 90 min. Next, N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MBTSTFA) + 1% tert-butyldimetheylchlorosilane (TBDMCS) were added and samples were incubated for 1 hr at 55 °C. Content of tubes was transferred to ALS vials for GC/MS analysis.
</p>
Cold glucose and glucose from the 13C artificial glucose mixture were converted to its glucose aldonitrile pentaacetate derivative after treatment for 30 min at 100 ºC with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine (2% v/v) and then acetic anhydride for 1 hr more. Excess reagent and solvent were removed by evaporation with N2, and the derivatized glucose was redissolved in ethyl acetate just before GC/MS analysis."	"Gas chromatography (GC) conditions were different depending on the analyzed sample. For all samples/methods a constant He flow of 1 ml/min was applied. Inlet temperature and oven temperature ramps were different depending on the analyzed metabolite:
</p>
- Polar intracellular metabolites: inlet temp. 270 ºC; oven temperature programmed as follows: 100 ºC for 3 min, then a 10 ºC/min ramp to 165 ºC, followed by a 2.5 ºC/min ramp to 225 ºC, next a 25 ºC/min ramp to 265 ºC, and a final 7.5 ºC/min ramp to 300 ºC. Retention times of the different determined metabolites were: pyruvate, 7.8 min; lactate, 10 min; alanine, 12.3 min; fumarate, 17.0 min; malate, 26.0 min; aspartate, 28.0 min; glutamate, 30.0 min; citrate, 35.0 min.
</p>
- Glucose: inlet temp. 250 ºC; oven temperature programmed as follows: 230 ºC for 2 min, then a 10 ºC/min ramp to 260 ºC, followed by a 25 ºC/min ramp to 270 ºC and hold for 2 min. Retention time of glucose was 3.6 min."	"Mass spectrometer (MS) source temperature was 230 ºC for polar intracellular metabolites and 300 ºC for glucose. MS quadrupole temperature was 150 ºC for all the methods. Ion source was Electron Impact Ionization (EI) for polar intracellular metabolites and fragments C1C4 and C3C6 of glucose, and Chemical Ionization (CI) for glucose-C1C6. Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM) was used in all the assays. Monitored m/z values were:

Acceptance criteria: Only peaks with intensity of the Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) lower than 8 million ions were accepted. Whether possible, only peaks with intensity of the Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) higher than 1 million ions were used."	"The ion clusters around the specific m/z were monitored for each analyzed metabolite to determine the fractional distribution of 13C. In brief, the areas of peaks for all ions in the cluster were extracted from raw data using equipment software. A value of each peak area is proportional to the fraction of ions with the same molecular weight. These data obtained represents the distribution of ions of various molecular weights that belong to the same compound or its fragment. Ions of various molecular weights are produced as a result of experimental isotope incorporation, the presence of isotopes in heteroatoms and the presence of natural abundance of 13C in the background. Also, derivatizing reagents often contain isotopes which contribute to the isotopologue distribution of the derivatized compound as well. Correction for all such contributions is necessary before one can determine the amount of isotope incorporation from artificially 13C labeled substrates and the distribution of isotopologues in the compound of interest. This correction was performed by using regression analysis using an in-house developed algorithm (R-mass)."	"Metabolites are not identified, just isotopologue distributions as consequence of incubation in the presence of the tracer are determined."
