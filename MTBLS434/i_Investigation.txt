Study Title	"Functional Metabolomics Describes the Yeast Biosynthetic Regulome."
Study Description	"Genome-metabolism interactions enable cell growth. To probe the extent of these interactions and delineate their functional contributions, we quantified the Saccharomyces amino acid metabolome and its response to systematic gene deletion. Over one-third of coding genes, in particular those important for chromatin dynamics, translation, and transport, contribute to biosynthetic metabolism. Specific amino acid signatures characterize genes of similar function. This enabled us to exploit functional metabolomics to connect metabolic regulators to their effectors, as exemplified by TORC1, whose inhibition in exponentially growing cells is shown to match an interruption in endomembrane transport. Providing orthogonal information compared to physical and genetic interaction networks, metabolomic signatures cluster more than half of the so far uncharacterized yeast genes and provide functional annotation for them. A major part of coding genes is therefore participating in gene-metabolism interactions that expose the metabolism regulatory network and enable access to an underexplored space in gene function."

Study Protocol Description	"The strains were transferred to synthetic minimal (SM) agar medium (6.7 g/l yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Y0626, SIGMA), 2% glucose, 2% agar) using a robot (Rotor, Singer instruments) and incubated for 48 hr at 30 °C. These spots were used for the inoculation of cultures in liquid SM (96-well plate, 150 µl/well) and were grown for 24 hr, diluted 1:20 and finally cultured in 96-deep well plates with 1.685 ml SM medium and 1 2-mm borosilicate bead/well for enhanced stirring. These plates were incubated for 8 hr in a Heidolph Titramax 1000 (900 rpm, 30 °C).
</p>
Strains from the same batch were cultivated and their metabolites extracted on the same day and analyzed together by LC-MS/MS. Before analysis by LC-MS/MS the order of samples within the same batch was randomized. During analysis a quality control sample (QC) was assessed every 24 samples and in total 237 times. The QC was prepared by joining the extracts of the first batch including metabolites of 351 deletion strains. Eventually, it was used to monitor analytical performance and to calculate the technical variation.
</p>
Standards preparation:</br>
Standards were prepared in 80% ethanol at different concentrations spanning a range of 100-fold above/below the expected concentration. The blank was 80% ethanol. Concentrations are indicated in the metabolite assignment file."	"Cells were collected by centrifugation, the medium discarded and the samples extracted with 200 µl 80 °C hot ethanol containing isotope labeled amino acid standards (50 µg/ml algae hydrolysate amino acid mixture (U-13C, 97%–99%; U-15N, 97%–99%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories CNLM-452-0.5) that were used for quality control and to detect outliers. Residual medium resulted in a final ethanol concentration of approximately 80%. The extract was heated for 2 min at 80°C, vigorously mixed on a vortex mixer and incubated for further 2 min at 80°C. The extract was cleared from debris by centrifugation and stored at -80°C. Before analysis, extracts were thawed and sonicated for 5 min. For chemical perturbation experiments, the supernatant was removed completely and the cells extracted with 200 µl 80% ethanol."	"Amino acids were separated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH amide column (130Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm x 100 mm) on a liquid chromatography (Agilent 1290 Infinity) and tandem mass spectrometry (Agilent 6460) system. Buffer A was composed of 50:50 acetonitrile/water (Greyhound Bio-012041, Greyhound 23214125), 10 mM ammonium formate (Fluka 14266), 0.176% formic acid (Fluka O6454) and buffer B of 95:5:5 acetonitrile/methanol/water (Greyhound BIO-13684102), 10 mM ammonium formate, 0.176% formic acid. The gradient elution was performed at a constant flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. Starting conditions were 85% buffer B, after 0.7 min the concentration of buffer B was decreased gradually to 5% until 2.55 min and kept for further 0.05 min before returning to initial conditions. The column was then equilibrated resulting in a total runtime of 3.25 min."	"Mass spectrometry analysis was caried out on a Agilent 6460 tandem mass spectrometry system. Signals for free amino acids were then acquired in dynamic SRM mode in Masshunter software and quantified by external calibration. The SRM transition are as follows: alanine (90 > 44.1), arginine (175.1 > 70 ), asparagine (133.1 > 74), aspartate (134.1 > 74), glutamate (148.1 > 84.1), glutamine (147.1 > 84), glycine (76 > 30.1), histidine (156.1 > 110.2), isoleucine (132.1 > 86), leucine (132.1 > 86), lysine (147.1 > 84), methionine (150.1 > 104), phenylalanine (166.1 > 120), proline (116.1 > 70.1), serine (106 > 60), threonine (120.1 > 74), tryptophane (205.1 > 188), tyrosine (182 > 165), valine (118.1 > 71.9)."	"Peak integration was performed with Agilent Masshunter Software.

Batch Normalization and Correction for Sample Dilution:</br>
For batch normalization we adapted the approach from the MIPHENO normalization workflow[1], where a scaling factor is calculated to bring the batch means to a global mean. First we calculated the overall mean considering all samples. Next, and in contrast to the previously described workflow, we compensated for dilution effects within batches by probabilistic quotient normalisation (PQN) before determining the mean for each batch. By dividing each sample by its respective batch mean and multiplying by the overall mean, we bring each batch to the same level. Finally, we corrected for sample dilution using PQN normalization.
</p>
Robust Estimation of Summary Statistics and Identification of Altered Metabolic Profiles:</br>
The unperturbed value for each metabolite is determined with robust statistical methods by excluding the contribution of few, significantly changing metabolites. We used the Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator to obtain robust values for mean, standard deviation, correlation and covariance for each amino acid. With the robust mean and covariance matrix we calculated Mahalanobis distances as robust multivariate metric for dissimilarity from the unaffected amino acid profile. p-values for the amino acid concentrations were calculated using the Z-test statistic. A p-value for the change in the overall amino acid profile was calculated from the Mahalanobis distance using the chi^2 statistic. All p-values were adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini & Hochberg method (BH) to identify significantly altered metabolic profiles.
