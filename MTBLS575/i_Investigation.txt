Study Title	"Maize Stem Response to Long-Term Attack by Sesamia nonagrioides"
Study Description	"Plants defend themselves against herbivores by activating a plethora of genetic and biochemical mechanisms aimed at reducing plant damage and insect survival. The short-term plant response to insect attack is well understood, but less is known about the maintenance of this response over time. We performed transcriptomic and metabolomics analyses in order to identify genes and metabolites involved in the long-term response of maize to attack by the corn borer Sesamina nonagrioides. To determine the role of elicitors present in caterpillar secretions, we also evaluated the response of maize stem challenged with insect regurgitates. The integrative analysis of the omics results revealed that the long-term response in maize is characterized by repression of the primary metabolism and a strong redox response, mainly mediated by germin-like proteins to produce anti-nutritive and toxic compounds that reduce insect viability, and with the glutathione–ascorbate cycle being crucial to minimize the adverse effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the plant. Our results suggest that different defense mechanisms are involved in the long-term response compared to those reported during the early response. We also observed a marginal effect of the caterpillar regurgitates on the long-term defensive response."

Study Protocol Description	"60 plants of the inbred line PB130 were individually grown in pots under greenhouse conditions. At maize silking, each treatment [infestation with Sesamia nonagrioides larvae, wounding, wounding + regurgitate, and control (untreated plants)] was applied to three different plants (biological replicates). The plants were infested by laying three 2nd instar larvae of S. nonagrioides on each maize plant. Larvae were placed between the leaf sheath and the stem, in the first and second internodes below the main ear. Wounding was performed with a scalpel; three wounds (scratches) of 5 x 5 mm were made to the leaf sheaths below the main ear. After wounding, 5 µl of 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) or S. nonagrioides regurgitate suspended in PBS was applied using a micropipette to each wound, depending on the treatment. The wound site was sealed with parafilm to reduce drying. Wounding and wounding + regurgitate application were repeated every other day. To obtain insect regurgitates, 50 S. nonagrioides larvae were gently pinched with tweezers, causing the regurgitation of approximately 2 µl that was re-suspended in phosphate buffer and kept frozen at -80 °C until use.
</p>
15 days after treatment application, a section (free of damage) of approximately 2 cm in the upper part of the stalk internode just below the ear was collected from each plant. The leaf sheath was discarded. Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and conserved at -80 °C."	"Metabolic profile was obtained in 3 biological replicates per treatment. Metabolites of each maize sample were isolated from 100 mg of frozen ground tissue in 1 ml of extraction buffer (50 mM of acetic acid in 40% MeOH (v/v)). Samples were vortexed for 20 min and centrifuged at 20,000 x g at 4 ºC. Extracts were filtered through a 0.22-µm membrane to remove particles."	"A 5 µl sample was injected into an UPLC-QTOF instrument (Waters HDMS Synapt; Waters Inc., Milford, MA, USA). Mobile phases were (A) H2O containing 5/0.1% (v/v) acetonitrile/formic acid (FA) and (B) acetonitrile containing 0.1% FA. The following gradient was used: 0–17.3 min, linear gradient from 0–22% B (v/v), 17.3–27.3 min 22–28% B, 27.3–28 min 28–40% B, 28–28.5 min 40–100% B, 28.5–30 min 100% B, 30–30.5 min 100-0% B, 30.5–32 min 0% B, using a 100 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm UPLC ethylene-bridged hybrid (BEH) C18 column (Waters Acquity, Waters Inc., Milford, MA, USA) with a flow of 0.3 ml/min."	"The following settings were applied to the Waters HDMS Synapt mass spectrometer during the LC-MS runs: capillary voltage at 3.0 kV; cone voltage at 28 eV; collision energy at 4 eV. For the LC-MS/MS runs, collision energy was set to 10–25 eV. Both negative and positive ionization modes were selected using the electrospray ionization (ESI) interface. The MassLynx Software version 4.1 (Waters Inc., Milford, MA, USA) was used to control the instrument and calculate accurate masses. Ion abundance with a P-value = 0.05 (1-way ANOVA) and a -1 = logFC = 1 were considered differentially accumulated in both conditions."	"Raw data files were converted to CDF format and processed using XCMS in R v3.4.3. The following parameters were used: feature detection method “centWave” (ppm 10, snthresh 6); peak grouping method “density” (bw=10); retention time correction method “loess”; peak integration method “chrom.” The first 1.5 min of each run was removed as these data represent unretained, highly polar compounds."	"For tentative identification, accurate mass data for the precursor was studied and compared to the spectral data of reference compounds with a mass tolerance of 15 ppm in public available databases (PubChem, KNApSAcK, Metlin and Chemspider)."
