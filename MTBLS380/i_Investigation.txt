Study Identifier	"MTBLS380"
Study Title	"A metabolomic study of adipose tissue in mice with a disruption of the circadian system"
Study Description	"Adipose tissue functions in terms of energy homeostasis as a rheostat for blood triglyceride, regulating its concentration, in response to external stimuli. In addition it acts as a barometer to inform the central nervous system of energy levels which can vary dramatically between meals and according to energy demand. Here a metabolomic approach, combining both Mass Spectrometry and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, was used to analyse both white and brown adipose tissue in mice with adipocyte-specific deletion of Arntl (also known as Bmal1), a gene encoding a core molecular clock component. The results are consistent with a peripheral circadian clock playing a central role in metabolic regulation of both brown and white adipose tissue in rodents and show that Arntl induced global changes in both tissues which were distinct for the two types. In particular, anterior subcutaneous white adipose tissue (ASWAT) tissue was effected by a reduction in the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids, while brown adipose tissue (BAT) changes were associated with a reduction in chain length. In addition the aqueous fraction of metabolites in BAT were profoundly affected by Arntl disruption, consistent with the dynamic role of this tissue in maintaining body temperature across the day/night cycle and an upregulation in fatty acid oxidation and citric acid cycle activity to generate heat during the day when rats are inactive (increases in 3-hydroxybutyrate and glutamate), and increased synthesis and storage of lipids during the night when rats feed more (increased concentrations of glycerol, choline and glycerophosphocholine). </p> The data and protocols for UPLC-QTOF-MS assay are reported in current study MTBLS380. </br> The data and protocols for NMR are reported in study MTBLS382.</br> The data and protocols for GC-FID are reproted in study MTBLS390."

Study Protocol Description	"A single loxP site and a Neo cassette flanked by an additional loxP site and 2 Frt sites were introduced into the introns upstream and downstream of coding exon 4 in mice bearing a conditional Arntlfx allele as previously described[1]. Mice were fed on a standard chow diet prior to the study. Mice were kept under an artificial light/dark, day/night, cycle: Lights were turned on at T0 and off at T12. Sampling at T0 and T18 therefore reflects metabolism during the night whilst T6 and T12 reflects metabolism during the day. Mice were euthanized under infrared light for tissue collection under circadian time. Adipose tissues (50-100 mg wet weight) were dissected under light and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Typically tissue was dissected within 1 min post mortem. All procedures were kept constant between controls and Arntl-/- mice. Studies were performed in accordance with the protocol approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mouse genotypes were assessed by PCR on genomic DNA from tail tips.

Nat Med, 2012. 18(12): p.1768-77</br>"	"Tissue extraction was performed using a modified method to that described by Le Belle and co-workers[1]. For each tissue sample 600 μl of methanol:chloroform (2:1 v/v) was added to 20 mg of frozen tissue. After being pulverised in a tissue lyser (Qiagen, UK) for 2 min at a frequency of 17/s, the sample was sonicated for  15 min. Following this, 200 μl of chloroform and 200 μl of water was added, then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. The separated aqueous and lipid phases were collected. The procedure was repeated twice. The organic fraction was left to dry in the fume hood under nitrogen gas overnight and the aqueous fraction was dried in an evacuated centrifuge.
</p>
50 μl of the original sample was added to a further 450 μl of methanol:chloroform (1:1, v/v).  10 μl was mixed with 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol (IPA):acetonitrile:water (2:1:1 v/v).

NMR Biomed, 2002. 15(1): p. 37-44.</br>"	"The samples were analyzed by LC-MS using a Waters quadrupole-time of flight (Q-ToF) G2 Xevo (Waters Ltd, Manchester, UK) interfaced with an Acquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatogram (UPLC). 5 μl of the sample was injected onto a 1.7 μm bridged ethyl hybrid C8 column (2.1 × 100 mm; Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK) held at 55 °C. The binary solvent system (flow rate 0.400 ml/min) consisted of solvent A which contained high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade acetonitrile and water (60:40) with 10 mM ammonium formate) (solvents and chemicals from Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset) and solvent B HPLC grade acetonitrile:isopropanol (10:90) and 10 mM ammonium formate (solvents and chemicals from Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset)). The gradient started from 60% A/40% B, reached 99% B in 18 min, then returned back to the starting condition and remained there for the next 2 min."	"The data was collected over the mass range of m/z 100–1200 with a scan duration of 0.2 sec and an interscan delay of 0.014 s. The source temperature was set at 120 °C and nitrogen was used as the desolvation gas (600 l/h) at 280 °C. The voltages of the sampling cone and capillary were 30 V and 3 kV, respectively and collision energy 4.6 V.  As lockmass, a solution of 2 ng/μl leucine enkephaline (m/z 556.2771) in 50:50 acetonitrile:water was infused into the instrument at 3 μl/min. "	"LC-MS chromatograms were analysed using Micromass Markerlynx. Applications Manager Version 4.1 (Waters Corporation). Peaks were normalized such that the sum of peaks for each sample was equal."	"Lipids were identified to 2 different levels of specificity. Where identification was performed using only exact mass and chromatography, these species are reported in terms of total number of carbons and double bonds on the species (e.g. TAG(48:3)). However, where fragmentation patterns allowed the fatty acids to be assigned, these are reported specifying the individual fatty acids (e.g. TAG(18:0/ 18:1/ 18:2). Note these specifications do not assign a given fatty acid to a given position in the lipid backbone."
