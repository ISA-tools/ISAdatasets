Study Title	"Piriformospora indica stimulates root metabolism of Arabidopsis thaliana"
Study Description	"Piriformospora indica is a root-colonizing fungus, which interacts with a variety of plants including Arabidopsis thaliana. This interaction has been considered as mutualistic, as it leads to an increased mycelia dry weight and increased shoot fresh weight, respectively. So far, only indolic glucosinolates and phytohormones have been identified as major key players. In a comprehensive non-targeted metabolite profiling study by means of UPLC/ESI-QTOFMS and GC/EI-QMS we analyzed Arabidopsis thaliana’s roots, root exudates, and leaves of inoculated and non-inoculated plants and identified further biomarkers. Among them, the concentration of nucleosides, dipeptides, oligolignols, and glucosinolate degradation products was affected in the exudates. In the root profiles, nearly all metabolite levels increased upon co-cultivation, namely those of carbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, glucosinolates, oligolignols, and flavonoids. In the leaf profiles, we detected by far less significant changes. We only observed an increased concentration in organic acids, carbohydrates, ascorbate, glucosinolates and hydroxycinnamic acids, and a decreased concentration in nitrogen-rich amino acids in inoculated plants."

Study Protocol Description	"P. indica was cultured on agar plates (1.5% (w/v) agar) for 3 weeks at 28 °C in the dark using Aspergillus minimal medium. For this purpose, a punched out agar block with mycelia of P. indica was placed in the center of a culture plate. 2-week old A. thaliana plantlets were co-cultivated for 2 weeks with P. indica in a hydroponic system under short day conditions (23 °C, 8 h light, 180 µE/m^2/s and 21 °C, 16 h dark). After 2 weeks of co-cultivation (4-week old plants) roots, leaves, and root exudates were harvested."	"Exudate samples were spiked with 20 µM 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid, evaporated until dryness, reconstituted in 9 ml water/methanol 95/5 (v/v) and subjected to a Bond Elut PPL cartridge (200 mg, 3 ml, Agilent Technologies, Boblingen). For this purpose, Bond Elut PPL cartridges were washed with 1 ml methanol, conditioned with 1 ml water/formic acid, 98/2 (v/v), loaded with 4 ml sample solution, washed with 1 ml water, and eluted with 2 ml methanol/formic acid, 99/2 (v/v). Finally, the eluate was dried and reconstituted in 120 µl water/methanol 70/30 (v/v) prior to UPLC-MS analysis.
</p>
Ground tissue material (leaf and root) was processed by solid liquid extraction using methanol/water, 80/20 (v/v) (40 mg root fresh weight corresponds to 200 µl extraction solution and 50 mg leaf fresh weight corresponds to 400 µl extraction solution). Frozen material was extracted twice with methanol/water, 80/20 (v/v) and reconstituted in methanol/water, 30/70 (v/v) prior to UPLC-MS-analysis. 100 µl extract of the remainder from the UPLC-MS-based metabolite profiling studies was spiked with 100 µM succinic acid-2,2,3,3-d4, dried down in a vacuum concentrator and subjected to a 2-step derivatization process."
