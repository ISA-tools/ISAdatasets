Study Title	"Transcriptomic and Metabolomics Profiling of Phage–Host Interactions between Phage PaP1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa"
Study Description	"The basic biology of bacteriophage–host interactions has attracted increasing attention due to a renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of bacteriophages. In addition, knowledge of the host pathways inhibited by phage may provide clues to novel drug targets. However, the effect of phage on bacterial gene expression and metabolism is still poorly understood. In this study, we tracked phage–host interactions by combining transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected with a lytic bacteriophage, PaP1. Compared with the uninfected host, 7.1% (399/5655) of the genes of the phage-infected host were differentially expressed genes (DEGs); of those, 354 DEGs were downregulated at the late infection phase. Many of the downregulated DEGs were found in amino acid and energy metabolism pathways. Using metabolomics approach, we then analyzed the changes in metabolite levels in the PaP1-infected host compared to un-infected controls. Thymidine was significantly increased in the host after PaP1 infection, results that were further supported by increased expression of a PaP1-encoded thymidylate synthase gene. Furthermore, the intracellular betaine concentration was drastically reduced, whereas choline increased, presumably due to downregulation of the choline–glycine betaine pathway. Interestingly, the choline–glycine betaine pathway is a potential antimicrobial target; previous studies have shown that betB inhibition results in the depletion of betaine and the accumulation of betaine aldehyde, the combination of which is toxic to P. aeruginosa. These results present a detailed description of an example of phage-directed metabolism in P. aeruginosa. Both phage-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes and phage-directed host gene expression may contribute to the metabolic changes observed in the host."

Study Protocol Description	"Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA1[1] and lytic phage PaP1[2] were stored in our laboratory at -80 °C in glycerol. P. aeruginosa was cultured aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (5 g yeast extract, 10 g tryptone, 10 g NaCl per liter) at 37 °C for all experiments. PaP1 particles were collected and purified using CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation[2].
</p>
Phage-infected bacteria or phage-free bacteria were cultured for 40 min. Briefly, 1 l of culture from each group was used for each NMR sample, and 5 replicate samples were prepared per group.

The cell pellets were subsequently washed thrice with pre-chilled PBS, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. All samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until NMR analysis."	"50 mg of freeze-dried cells per sample was weighed and suspended in 1 ml ultrapure water. Cell suspensions were further sonicated on ice for 8 cycles of a 4 s on/3 s off cycling program (Sonics VX-130, USA) and then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C. The cell lysate was filtered through a 3 KDa ultrafiltration membrane (Mimacon, USA) at 13,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. 50 µl DSS standard solution (Anachro, Canada) was added to 450 µl filtrate per sample, and centrifuged at 13,000 x g at 4 °C for 2 min before being transferred to the NMR tubes (Norwell, USA)."	"Metabolic profiling and peak identification were performed by Anachro Technologies Inc. (Wuhan, China) using described methods[1][2]. All of the NMR experiments were performed on an Agilent DD2 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm CPTCI 1H-13C/15N/D Z-GRD, triple-resonance cryogenic probe at 298.15 K.

Spectra were acquired with 64 transient scans."	"A line broadening of 0.5 Hz was applied to the free induction decay prior to the Fourier transformation, phasing, and baseline correction. Data were then carefully phased and baseline corrected in Chenomx Processor."	"Metabolites were identified and quantified using Chenomx NMR Suit (version 8.1, Chenomx, Edmonton, AB, Canada). All spectra were referenced to the internal standard (DSS) and analyzed by experienced analysts against the Chenomx Compound Library. From the 10 spectra, 48 metabolites were identified and quantified. All information on metabolite concentration were exported to excel and normalized by weight across all parallel samples before use in the multivariable analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were performed by pcaMethod Bioconductor and pls package in R. ggplot2 in R was used for data visualization."
