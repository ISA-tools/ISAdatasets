Study Title	"Illuminating a plant’s tissue-specific metabolic diversity using computational metabolomics and information theory"
Study Description	"While cross-tissue metabolite variations are increasingly regarded as important readouts of tissue-level gene regulatory processes, these have rarely been explored by non-targeted metabolomics. Here we explore tissue-level metabolic specialization in Nicotiana attenuata, an ecological model with rich secondary metabolism by combining tissue-wide non-targeted mass spectral data acquisition, information theory analysis, and MS/MS molecular networks. This analysis was conducted for two different methanolic extracts of 14 tissues and deconvoluted 895 non-redundant MS/MS spectra. Using information theory analysis, anthers were found to harbor the most specialized metabolome and, through MS/MS molecular networks, most unique metabolites of anthers and other tissues were annotated. Finally, tissue-metabolite association maps were used to predict tissue-specific gene functions. Predictions for the function of two UDP-glycosyltransferases in flavonoid metabolism were confirmed by virus-induced gene-silencing. The present workflow allows biologists to amortize the vast amount of data produced by modern MS instrumentation for their quest to understand gene function."

Study Protocol Description	"We extracted 14 different tissues from 28 and 50-day-old Nicotiana. attenuata plants growing in the glasshouse. Non-reproductive tissue sample collection included: a pool of all non-senescing rosette leaves, combined lower, middle and higher segments of the stem, the complete root system and matured seeds. Reproductive parts were harvested as follows; complete floral buds of 8 mm length – a stage at which the corolla has not yet protruded from the sepals – were harvested. Mature flowers at anthesis (5 days post-8mm stage, 7pm), were carefully separated into the following parts: the pedicel, complete sepal ring, the nectary, the ovary (not including the nectary), the style, anthers, filaments (not including anthers), the corolla tube (not including the limb) and the corolla limb."	"Pools of 100 mg of isolated tissues were extracted as follows using extraction buffers containing either 20% or 80% of methanol to increase the coverage of chemically-diverse metabolite classes. 1 ml extraction buffer (50 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.8, containing 20% or 80% methanol) per 100 mg tissue was added and samples were homogenized in a ball mill (Genogrinder 2000; SPEX CertiPrep) for 45 s at 1× rate and 250 strokes per min. Homogenized samples were centrifuged at 16,000 x g, 4 °C for 30 min, and supernatants were transferred into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and re-centrifuged as before. Supernatants of 400 μl were transferred to 2 ml glass vials for mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. In order to prevent the discarding of tissue-specific metabolites from the XCMS analysis due to poor grouping across samples, 5 mixed extracts containing all 14 tissues at different ratios were generated and processed simultaneously with all other tissue samples."	"2 µl of the 20% or 80% methanol leaf extracts were separated by U-HPLC performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) system with an Acclaim (Thermo Scientific) column, particle size 2.2 µm, 2.1 x 150 mm and a 4 mm x 4 mm guard column
of the same material[1]. The following binary gradient was applied at 30 ºC: 0 to 1 min, isocratic 90% A (de-ionized water, 0.1% [v/v] acetonitrile and 0.05% formic acid), 10% B (acetonitrile and 0.05% formic acid); 1 to 40 min, gradient phase to 10% A, 90% B; 40 to 45 min, isocratic 10% A, 90% B.  Flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. Injection volume 2 µl (positive detection mode), 3 µl (negative detection mode).

Development and validation of a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry method for induced changes in Nicotiana attenuata leaves during simulated herbivory. Journal of agricultural and food chemistry, 2010, 58(17), 9418-9427.</br>"	"Eluted compounds were detected by a high-resolution MicroToF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an electrospray ionization source operating in positive ionization mode. Typical instrument settings were as follows: capillary voltage 4500 V, capillary exit 130 V, dry gas temperature 200 °C, dry gas flow of 8 l/min. Ions were detected from m/z 50 to 1400 at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. Mass calibration was performed using sodium formate clusters (10 mM solution of NaOH in 50/50% v/v isopropanol/water containing 0.2% formic acid). idMS/MS datasets were acquired by operating the instrument with an isolation mass 400 Da, an isolation width 300 Da (largest width meaning all mass is accessible) and collision energies set either to 20, 30, 40, 50ev to cover broad range mass signal fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation (CID). idMS/MS data collection was restricted to ten samples that were initially selected based on the high range of chemical variations within the total sample population that these samples captured. Four microliters of each of these samples were first analyzed by UHPLC-ESI/qTOF-MS in profile mode (single MS approach, collision energy of 0 ev) using the aforementioned chromatographic conditions with the objective of identifying compound precursors later on associated with molecular fragments as well as of inferring fragmentation patterns due to in-source collision during ionization (low cone voltage settings). The same samples were then analyzed for idMS/MS data acquisition at 4 different collision energy conditions (20, 30, 40 and 50ev) separately with all detectable mass signals being equally considered as dissociation targets. "	"Raw data files were converted to netCDF format using the export function of the Data Analysis v4.0 software (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany)."	"This MS profile dataset (MS1) and 4 CID-derived MS/MS datasets were rapidly aligned and post-processed using open source programs. The correlation analysis for precursor-to-product assignment was implemented using an R script and rules were operated using a C# script available at the following github account web link: https://github.com/PlantDefenseMetabolism."
