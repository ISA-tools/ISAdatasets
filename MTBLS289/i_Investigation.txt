STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS289"
Study Title	"Analysis of colorectal adenocarcinoma tissue samples by DESI mass spectrometry imaging"
Study Description	"Ex vivo colorectal adenocarcinoma samples were analysed by desorption electrospray ionisation using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The samples were analysed in negative mode over the m/z range 600-1000. Some of the samples presented in this dataset were analysed as part of [1]. The study makes available imzML files of profile and centroid mode data, as well as low- and high- resolution optical image files of H&E-stained sections. These files can be found in the zip file named after each tissue section. </p> Ref:</br> [1] Gerbig S, Golf O, Balog J, Denes J, Baranyai Z, Zarand A, Raso E, Timar J, Takats Z.

Study Protocol Description	"Tissue specimens were removed during surgical interventions and were fresh-frozen immediately at -196 °C. Specimens were transported to 2nd Institute of Pathology, Semmelweis University on dry ice and were stored at -80 °C prior to further processing."	"Series of 12-µm-thick sections were prepared using a Thermo Shandon Cryotome. Samples were transferred to the mass spectrometry facility on dry ice and were immediately stored in a -85 °C freezer to avoid deterioration of the tissue. Prior to measurements, samples were thawed and immediately analyzed. The research protocol was approved by IRB of the National Health Science Council (TUKEB83/2009)."	"For imaging measurements, a home-built motorized DESI ion source was used and the software has also been developed. More technical detail and a photograph of the home-built DESI ion source are provided in the Electronic Supplementary Material of the associated publication. In addition, an Omni Spray 2D motorized Prosolia ion source (Model OS-3201) and Osprey software for controlling the stage were used.
</p>
The analysis was performed using a LTQ XL Orbitrap Discovery mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Bremen, Germany). This spectrometer consists of a linear ion trap in the front part and an Orbitrap analyzer in the rear part. The Orbitrap analyzer was used for the acquisition of reported data. The mass resolution used for all measurements was set to 30,000 with a mass accuracy of better than 4 ppm.
</p>
Spatial resolution of the imaging experiments was set to 100 µm unless otherwise stated. Scanning speed of the DESI sprayer over the tissue sample was 100 µm/s.
The height distance between the DESI sprayer and the sample surface was set to 4 mm; the distance between the sprayer and the inlet capillary was 7 mm. All presented spectra were recorded in negative ion mode. All mass spectra were recorded in the mass range of m/z = 600–1,000.
</p>
Additional instrument parameters of imaging experiments of colorectal adenocarcinoma samples:</br>
Spray angle: 80°; High voltage: 5 kV; Solvent flow rate: 1 µl/min; Inlet capillary temperature: 250 °C; Nitrogen pressure: 7 bar; Tube lens: 120 V."	"Neighbouring tissue sections to those analysed by DESI were stained with H&E and subjected to histopathological assessment. High and low resolution optical images are made available."	"All Thermo raw mass spectrometric data were converted to imzML format via imzML Converter (version 1.0.5) [1]. Both profile and centroid mode data files are made available in this study.
