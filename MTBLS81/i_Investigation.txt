Study Title	"The impact of genetic stress by ATGL deficiency on the lipidome of lipid droplets from murine hepatocytes"
Study Description	"We showed earlier that nutritional stress like starvation or high fat diet resulted in phenotypic changes in the lipidomes of hepatocyte lipid droplets (LDs), representative for the pathophysiological status of the mouse model. Here we extend our former study by adding genetic stress due to knock-out (KO) of adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the rate limiting enzyme in LD lipolysis. An intervention trial for 6 weeks with male wild-type (WT) and ATGL-KO mice was carried out; both genotypes were fed lab chow or were exposed to short-time starvation. Isolated LDs were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine lipidomes, in that order, provided best phenotypic signatures characteristic for respective stresses applied to the animals. This was evidenced at lipid species level by principal component analysis, calculation of average values for chain-lengths and numbers of double bonds, and by visualization in heat maps. Structural backgrounds for analyses and metabolic relationships were elaborated at lipid molecular species level. Relating our lipidomic data to non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases of nutritional and genetic etiologies with or without accompanying insulin resistance, phenotypic distinction in hepatocyte LDs dependent on insulin status emerged. Taken together, lipidomes of hepatocyte lipid droplets are sensitive responders to nutritional and genetic stress."

Study Protocol Description	"Samples of hepatocytes isolated from individual mice were re-suspended in disruption buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF) and kept for 15 min on ice. The cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation at 800 psi for 10 min using nitrogen bomb and the resulting homogenate was transferred to a 50 ml Greiner-tube and centrifuged at 1000 x g (Beckman CS-6R rotor) for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant obtained was transferred to an SW41 ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with buffer containing 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF. The centrifugation was carried out at 100,000 x g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (SW41 rotor, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) for 1 h at 4 °C; lipid droplets (LD) floated in a white band at the top of the tube. Floating LD were collected into another SW41 tube and overlaid with the same buffer and centrifuged at same speed in the Beckman ultracentrifuge (SW41 rotor) for 1 h at 4 °C, in order to avoid cytosol contamination. Re-floating LD were collected and used in all further experiments."	"Samples were spiked with 40 nmol TG 17:0/17:0/17:0, 1.2 nmol PC 12:0/12:0, 2.4 nmol phosphatidyle- thanolamine (PE) 12:0/12:0, and 4 nmol phosphatidylserine (PS) 12:0/12:0 as internal standards and lipids were extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether. This ether extract was taken to dryness and the remainder solubilized in around 2 ml CHCl3/methanol 1:1 (v/v). For TG class determination 1:100, for all other class determinations 1:4 dilutions were prepared using the same solvent. For LC-MS/MS measurements, 200 µl aliquots were always taken from the dilutions and a solution mix of 45 LIPID MAPS internal standards (See manuscript supplementary Table I) was added, taken to dryness and resuspended in 200 µl solvent as above."	"5 µl of spiked samples were injected onto a Thermo 1.9 µm Hypersil C18, 100 x 1 mm, HPLC column mounted in an Accela HPLC instrument (Thermo Scientific). Solvent A was water with 1% ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid, solvent B was acetonitrile/2-propanol 5:2 (v/v) with 1% ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid. The gradient ran from 35% to 70% B in 4 min, then to 100% B in another 16 min, and was held there for further 10 min. The flow rate was 250 µl/min."	"Data acquisition was performed by Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR-MS) (Linear Trap Quadrupole-Fourier Transform, LTQ-FT; Thermo Scientific) full scans at a resolution of 200,000 and <2 ppm mass accuracy with external calibration. Spray voltage was set to 5,000 V in positive mode and to -4,500 V in negative mode, capillary voltage to 35 V, and the tube lens was at 120 V. Capillary temperature was set to 250 °C. From the FT-ICR-MS preview scan, the four most-abundant m/z values were picked in data-dependent acquisition mode, fragmented in the linear ion trap, and ejected at nominal mass resolution. Normalized collision energy was set to 35%, repeat count was two, and exclusion duration was 60 s."	"Data were automatically processed by Lipid Data Analyzer. Data were transformed from raw data to mzXML and further transformed into Chrom files."	"The MS profiling of individual lipid classes relied on our on-line LC-MS/MS platform in combination with LDA [1][2]. This approach permitted quantitative analysis of TG, DG, PL, and SM species, characterized by their numbers of carbon atoms and numbers of double bonds in constituent acyl residues. PL species included those of PC, LPC, PI, PS, and PE classes. Taken together, a total of 204 different lipid species were identified in this study. Our experimental conduct [1] did not aim for phosphatidic acid (PA), cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester (CE) classes, due to methodological considerations and the properties of the biological sample (bulk amounts of TG). Within the detection limits of the method, ether lipids were found. In the following, we present data on TG, DG, and PL species in ‰ relative to total amount of respective lipid class to facilitate recognition of nutritional phenotypes at lipidomic levels.
</p>
Constituent FA of phosphatidylserine (PS), PE, PC, DG, and TG species were analyzed in positive MS/MS spectra by respective FA neutral losses. FA composition of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) and sphingomyelins (SMs) was obvious by elemental composition derived from high-resolution MS data and by lipid class-specific fragments (m/z 184). FA composition for phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecular species was elucidated by their carboxylate anions in negative MS/MS spectra. The most-abundant FA fragment or neutral loss in an MS/MS spectrum was normalized to 100% (base peak). Fragments indicative for FA with less than 25% intensity of the base peak were termed minor FA fragments and all others were termed major FA fragments. For better manageability, particularly of isobaric species, possible combinations predominantly composed of major fragments were considered major molecular species, and possible combinations predominantly composed of minor fragments were considered minor molecular species.
