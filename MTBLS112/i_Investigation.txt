Study Title	"GC-MS based targeted metabolic profiling identifies changes in the wheat metabolome following deoxynivalenol treatment"
Study Description	"Fusarium graminearum and related species commonly infest grains causing the devastating plant disease Fusarium head blight (FHB) and the formation of trichothecene mycotoxins. The most relevant toxin is deoxynivalenol (DON), which acts as a virulence factor of the pathogen. FHB is difficult to control and resistance to this disease is a polygenic trait, mainly mediated by the quantitative trait loci (QTL) Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. In this study we established a targeted GC-MS based metabolomics workflow comprising a standardized experimental setup for growth, treatment and sampling of wheat ears and subsequent GC-MS analysis followed by data processing and evaluation of QC measures using tailored statistical and bioinformatics tools. This workflow was applied to wheat samples of six genotypes with varying levels of Fusarium resistance, treated with either DON or water, and harvested 0, 12, 24, 48 and 96 hours after treatment. The results suggest that the primary carbohydrate metabolism and transport, the citric acid cycle and the primary nitrogen metabolism of wheat are clearly affected by DON treatment. Most importantly significantly elevated levels of amino acids and derived amines were observed. In particular, the concentrations of the three aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan increased. No clear QTL specific difference in the response could be observed except a generally faster increase in shikimate pathway intermediates in genotypes containing Fhb1. The overall workflow proved to be feasible and facilitated to obtain a more comprehensive picture on the effect of DON on the central metabolism of wheat."

Study Protocol Description	"Six different spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines were used in the experiments. Treated ears were sampled either directly after treatment (time point 0) or 12, 24, 48 and 96 hr after treatment. The ear was cut from the plant and the non-treated spikelets were removed by clipping the rachis with a surgical scissor below and above the treated spikelets. The treated ear part including the rachis and complete spikelets (chaff and florets) was put in a small vial. Harvested samples were immediately quenched in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at -80 °C until further processing. Each of the frozen wheat samples were milled to a fine powder for 2 min at 30 Hz using a ball mill (MM301 Retsch, Germany) with liquid nitrogen pre-cooled 10 ml stainless steel vessels and a 9-mm stainless steel ball."	"The homogenized wheat ears (100±2 mg fresh weight) were weighed into Eppendorf tubes and extracted with 1 ml of pre-cooled methanol/water 3+1 (v/v) including 0.1% formic acid, by vortexing for 10 s and further treatment in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 8,500 x g at 4 °C and 200 µl of the supernatant were combined with 140 µl water, 75 µl chloroform and 10 µl of internal standard mixture. After shaking, the tubes were again centrifuged for 4 min at 8,500 x g at 4 °C and 200 µl of the methanol/water phase were transferred into micro-inserts in GC/HPLC vials. The samples were evaporated overnight using a centrifugal evaporator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO) at 15 °C and subsequently put on the GC autosampler (PAL LHX-xt, CTC Analytics, Carrboro, NC) for an optimized online two step derivatization procedure. The sample was re-suspended in 40 µl MOX (20 mg/mL pyridine) and agitated for 90 min at 60 °C. Thereafter, 50 µl MSTFA and 10 µl internal standard (NONA, 370 mg/l) were added before the vial was again agitated at 60 °C for 60 min. Prior to analysis, the samples were kept in the drawer for 10 min at 4 °C to allow equilibration and sedimentation of particles."	"For separation and detection of analytes an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled to a 5975C inert XL MSD detector (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) was used. The instruments were controlled by ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies, version E.02.01.1177). A volume of 1 µl of the liquid sample was injected into the split/splitless injector at 250 °C in split mode and using a split of 25:1. An HP5-ms column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) was operated at a constant flow of 1 ml/min helium. After keeping the oven at 50 °C for 2 min, it was heated to 310 °C (10 °C/min) and subsequently kept at this temperature for 15 min."	"Compounds were detected from m/z 50-800 utilizing the 5975C inert XL MSD detector (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The MSD interface was kept at 290 °C throughout the run. After 7 min of solvent delay, the detector was used in scan mode m/z 50–800. The EI source was kept at 230 °C and the MSD quadrupole at 150 °C. Autotuning of the MSD was performed at least once a week or after exchange of spare parts, such as the liner which was exchanged after a maximum of 70 injections. All samples were measured in a randomized manner."	"Raw GC-MS data files were acquired by ChemStation and exported in the net.cdf format. The converted files were subsequently imported by the MetaboliteDetector software (version 2.5.20130104-Linux) and further processed. Besides mass spectral deconvolution (settings: peak threshold 5; minimum peak height 5; deconvolution width 7; required number of peaks 20) and computation of feature areas for relative quantification, the retention index for compound recognition was calculated and the corresponding spectra were compared to an in-house library."	"Retention indices and GC-MS spectra were compared to an in-house library. This library was established by measuring 132 authentic reference standards using the same derivatization protocol, analytical parameters and instrument as the wheat samples analysed in this study. Metabolites were identified by comparison of mass spectra and retention indices to the spectra library using a cut-off value of 70%. The feature areas of three specific fragment ions were recorded for each metabolite and the ion with the highest signal to noise ratio was detected by an in-house, Python based software, and chosen for further data processing and comparative quantification in all samples."
