Study Title	"Untargeted Metabolomics Reveals a Mild Impact of Remote Ischemic Conditioning on the Plasma Metabolome and α-Hydroxybutyrate as a Possible Cardioprotective Factor and Biomarker of Tissue Ischemia"
Study Description	"Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a maneuver by which short non-lethal ischemic events are applied on distant organs or limbs to reduce ischemia and reperfusion injuries caused by e.g. heart attacks. As RIC can be induced using a simple blood pressure cuff e.g. prior to revascularization, it constitutes an easily applicable, safe and low-cost intervention to limit these injuries. Although intensively investigated, the specific mechanism of this protective phenomenon remains incompletely understood. Likewise, the identity of circulating factors, presumed to be involved in the initiation of protection, is unknown. In this study, we aimed to study perturbations in the plasma metabolome following RIC and gain insight into metabolic changes by the intervention as well as to identify potential novel cardio-protective metabolites. Blood plasma samples from 10 healthy males were collected prior to and after RIC and analyzed using untargeted LC-qTOF-MS. The analysis revealed a moderate impact on the plasma metabolome following RIC. However, one metabolite, α-hydroxybutyrate (AHB), stood out as highly significantly upregulated after RIC. AHB might be a novel and more sensitive plasma-biomarker of transient tissue ischemia than lactate. Importantly, it was also found that a cell permeable AHB precursor protects cardiomyocytes from ischemia-reperfusion damage."

Study Protocol Description	"Two separate sets of blood samples were obtained from the same volunteers constituting a calibration set for data inspection and a validation set in which findings were confirmed. The two sets were collected, using an identical protocol, at least one month apart from ten healthy, lean men in the age of 18-45 yr. Inclusion criteria required that no physical activity was performed 48 h prior to sampling and that intake of drugs, alcohol, and caffeine was avoided 24 hr before this time. All samples were collected after minimum 12 hr of fasting. RIC was induced by ischemia/reperfusion of the upper arm using the AutoRICTM device (CellAegis Devices Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada). The RIC maneuver consisted of a total of four consecutive cycles of 5 min inflation of a blood pressure cuff to above arterial systolic pressure and 5 min deflation. Blood samples (9 ml) were collected in lithium heparin tubes from the contralateral arm immediately before and after the RIC maneuver. Immediately after sample collection, plasma was recovered by centrifugation (500 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and kept on ice until the end of sample collection. Samples were stored at -80 °C until analysis."	"Plasma samples were thawed and aliquots transferred to a clean 96-well plate in duplicates (160 µl). Ice-cold methanol (600 µl) was added to each well and the plate was shaken (1,000 rpm, 5 min, rt) and incubated (10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was separated by centrifugation (2,000 x g, 10 min, 4 °C) and transferred to glass inserts in a separate 96-well plate. Ice-cold methanol/water (80:20) (600 µl) was added to the pellet and the extraction was repeated. Supernatants were pooled and evaporated to dryness under N2. Samples were re-suspended in Millipore water, 0.1% formic acid (160 µl), and a 10 µl aliquot of each sample was combined to obtain quality control (QC) samples, before the plate was sealed for analysis. Two samples were excluded due to errors in sample preparation giving a total of 38 samples. Samples included in the validation set were prepared in a similar manner, however only one aliquot was transferred to the 96-well plate, resulting in 20 samples."	"For untargeted analyses, separation was performed on a Acquity UPLC I-Class system from Waters Corporation (Milford, MA, USA)
using a HSS C18 column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.8 µm, Waters Corporation) at 50 °C. The mobile phase consisted of Millipore water, 0.1% formic acid (A1) and acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (B1), and a constant flow rate of 0.6 ml/min spanned the total runtime of 15 min. A gradient elution was isocratic at 0.0-2.0 min at 0% B1, linear from 0 to 40% B1 at 2.0-6.0 min, linear from 40 to 60% B1 at 6.0-6.5 min, linear from 60 to 88% B1 at 6.5-11.0 min, linear from 88 to 100% B1 at 11.0-11.5 min, linear from 100 to 0% B1 at 11.5-12.5 min and isocratic at 0% B1 for column equilibration at 12.5-15.0 min. Data were acquired from 0.2 to 11.5 min. Samples were kept at a constant temperature of 7 °C and the injection volume was 2 µl in ESI+ mode and 10 µl in ESI- mode."	"The Bruker maXis Impact QTOF (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometry instrument was operated in both positive and negative electrospray ionization mode, the capillary voltage was 4.0 kV (ESI+) and 2.5 kV (ESI-). The nebulizing gas pressure was 4 bar, and the drying gas flow and temperature were 11 l/min and 220 °C. Scans were acquired at a rate of 4 Hz using a mass range of 50-1,000 m/z. Calibration of the instrument was performed using sodium formate/acetate for positive ionization mode and sodium formate for negative ionization mode and was followed by a subsequent recalibration of all samples in DataAnalysis (Bruker) to improve mass accuracy further."	"Calibrated data were examined in DataAnalysis (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and converted to the file mzXML format by CompassXport (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Features, described by an m/z value, a retention time, and an area under curve, were extracted with XCMS using R project, version 3.2.0 (http://www.R-project.org). Removal of calibration scans (30 scans) was performed prior to peak detection. CAMERA was used for grouping of features and annotations of isotopes and adducts. Peak detection was performed using the CentWave algoritm with 12 ppm resolution and with a signal-to-noise threshold of 6. Retention time correction was performed with the Obiwarp algoritm. Selected peaks should be present at least in 50% of the samples of either group (before or after the RIC intervention) to be included for further analyses."	"In accordance with reported guidelines, features in the calibration set with CV(QC) > 30% were excluded in the further data handling, while the remaining data were transferred to SIMCA 13.0 software (Umetrics, Sweden) for multivariate data analysis. Based on variable influence on projection (VIP) scores and coefficients, an orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model was optimized by removal of features irrelevant for the separation between plasma collected before and plasma collected after the RIC stimulus. The optimized model provided VIP scores, and features were selected for identification when satisfying demands of having area under curve > 5,000 (XCMS, mean of duplicates) and 0.9 > fold change > 1.1 (pairwise comparison) as well as either p < 0.05 (paired t-test) to indicate a significant change or VIP > 1 (SIMCA) suggesting an importance in the multivariate data analysis. The paired t-test used the average of the replicate analysis results in the calibration set and the single analysis results in the validation study. Deduction of possible precursors was guided by grouping and annotations made by XCMS and CAMERA. In order to ensure the relevance of the selected features in regard to the RIC stimulus, features showing a similarly directed regulation in both calibration and validation set were considered valid, while inconsistencies discarded the features from further identification. For the validation set VIP scores (SIMCA) were deduced from an OPLS-DA model based on all features detected with CV(QC)) < 30%. For tentative identification, selected features were searched against the freely accessible databases METLIN (https://metlin.scripps.edu) and The Human Metabolome Database, HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/) based on their m/z value. For some features no hits were found, and a possible identification was deduced based on fragmentation patterns. When possible, final identification of all features was established by comparison of m/z value, retention time, and fragmentation patterns to reference compounds."
