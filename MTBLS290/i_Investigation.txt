Study Title	"Normalization techniques for PARAFAC modeling of urine metabolomics data"
Study Description	"One of the body fluids often used in metabolomics studies is urine. The peak intensities of metabolites in urine are affected by the urine history of an individual resulting in dilution differences. This requires therefore normalization of the data to correct for such differences. Two normalization techniques are commonly applied to urine samples prior to their further statistical analysis. First, AUC normalization aims to normalize a group of signals with peaks by standardizing the area under the curve (AUC) within a sample to the median, mean or any other proper representation of the amount of dilution. The second approach uses specific end-product metabolites such as creatinine and all intensities within a sample are expressed relative to the creatinine intensity. Another way of looking at urine metabolomics data is by realizing that the ratios between peak intensities are the information-carrying features. This opens up possibilities to use another class of data analysis techniques designed to deal with such ratios: compositional data analysis. In this approach special transformations are defined to deal with the ratio problem. In essence, it comes down to using another distance measure than the Euclidian Distance that is used in the conventional analysis of metabolomics data. We will illustrate using this type of approach in combination with three-way methods (i.e. PARAFAC) to be used in cases where samples of some biological material are measured at multiple time points. Aim of the paper is to develop PARAFAC modeling of three-way metabolomics data in the context of compositional data and compare this with standard normalization techniques for the specific case of urine metabolomics data."

Study Protocol Description	"Urine samples were collected from newborns with perinatal asphyxia in five time points (7, 28, 52, 76 and 100 hr after the birth) and stored at -80 °C. At the time of analysis, the samples were thawed on ice, centrifuged at 10000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and diluted with LC-MS grade water to contain the same concentration of creatinine. A small volume of each sample was pooled and used as quality control samples (QC)."	"N/A"	"The liquid chromatography was carried out on Dionex UltiMate 3000 RS system (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The separation was performed on aminopropyl LUNA column (100 x 2 mm, 3 µm particle size) protected by guard column (4 x 2 mm ID) of the same material (Phenomenex, Torrance, USA). The mobile phase A consisted of 20 mM ammonium acetate at pH 9.75 and mobile phase B consisted of acetonitrile. The gradient was: 0 – 7 min: 95% - 10% B; 7 – 13 min: 10% B; 13 – 13.5 min: 10% - 95% B; 13.5–17 min: 95% B. The column was maintained at 35 °C and the flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. The injection volume was 1-10 µl."	"The liquid chromatography was coupled to triple quadrupole QTRAP 5500 tandem mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA).The setting of mass spectrometer was as follows: curtain gas: 30 psi; ion spray voltage: ± 4500 V; both ion source gases: 40 psi and source temperature: 400 °C. Multiple reaction monitoring mode in both positive and negative ionisation mode was used for detection of 354 metabolites, which are typical for biological matrices. Compound parameters as collision energy, declustering potential, entrance potential and collision cell exit potential were previously optimized on standards. The equipment was controlled by the Analyst 1.6.2 software."	"Data were processed in the R software[1]; in addition to standard packages also those on PARAFAC modelling[2][3] and analysis of compositional data[4] were employed. At first, quality control-based robust LOESS (LOcal regrESSion) signal correction method was applied[5], and consequently also zero replacement according to[6] in order to enable further processing based on logarithmic calculations. Finally, both the standard log-transformation and the centred logratio (clr) transformation were applied on the data structure.
