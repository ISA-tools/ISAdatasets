STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS225"
Study Title	"Targeted metabolomic analysis in hepatic extracts, serum, and urine of female mice gavaged with TCDD every 4 days for 28 days"
Study Description	"TCDD is an environmental contaminant that elicits a number of hepatic effects including fat accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis that can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. RNA-Seq and targeted metabolomics were integrated with complementary dioxin response element (DRE) location and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ChIP-Seq data to further investigate the hepatotoxicity of TCDD. Our integrative analysis identified changes similar to the Warburg effect observed in cancer cells, including pyruvate kinase isoform switching (PKM1 to PKM2), and an increase in the glutaminase (GLS1) GAC:KGA isoform ratio. Consequently, metabolites are redirected towards the pentose phosphate pathway, serine biosynthesis, and glutaminolysis. We propose that the effects of TCDD on central carbon and amino acid metabolism represents AhR-mediated hepatic metabolic reprogramming in order to increase NADPH production as an oxidative stress counter-measure."

Study Protocol Description	"Postnatal day 25 (PND25) female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Portage, MI), housed in polycarbonate cages with cellulose fiber chips (Aspen Chip Laboratory Bedding, Northeastern Products, Warrensberg, NY) at 30-40% humidity and a 12h light/dark cycle and acclimatized for 4 days, were fed ad libitum (Harlan Teklad 22/5 Rodent Diet 8940, Madison, WI) with free access to deionized water. On PND 28 and every following 4th day animals (N = 5) were orally gavaged with 0.1 ml sesame oil or TCDD (Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI) for a total of 28 days (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 µg/kg).  Blood was collected on day 28 by submandibular vein puncture into BD microtainer tubes with serum separator (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 min and serum was immediately stored at -80 ºC. Liver samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 ºC. Urine was collected from individual mice over 2 h on
day 26 in the absence of food or water and stored immediately at -80 ºC."	"Liver (~100 mg) and serum (30 µl) aqueous metabolites were extracted by chloroform:water:methanol. Briefly, frozen liver samples were homogenized (Polytron PT2100, Kinematica) or vortexed (serum) in HPLC grade methanol:water (5:3, 4.63 ml, -20 °C) in Pyrex glass tubes. HPLC-grade chloroform was added following homogenization (methanol:water:chloroform, 5:3:5), vortexed, shaken on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 3,000 x g. The transferred aqueous phase was dried under nitrogen gas at room temperature and resuspended in HPLC-grade water prior to analysis. Hepatic extract protein layers were dried and a bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma-Aldrich) on a Tecan Infinite 200 microplate reader (Männedorf, Switzerland) was used to normalize signal in liver.
</p>
Amino acids were carbobenzyloxy (cbz) derivatized for analysis. Redissolved solutions (20 µl) were added to 80 µl of HPLC-grade methanol, and 2.5 µl of triethylamine. 0.5 µl benzylchloroformate was added and samples were vortexed then centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to HPLC vials for analysis."	"Liver and Urine:</br>
Hepatic extracts were first loaded onto a trapping column (C18, 4 mm x 2 mm, from Phenomenex) and washed for 30 seconds with HPLC grade water containing 10 mM tributylamine and 15 mM acetic acid for desalting. Hepatic extracts were examined by liquid chromatography (LC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) as previously described[1] using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA), and a Synergi Hydro column (4 µm particle size, 80 Å, 150 mm x 2 mm, from Phenomenex). Urine samples, collected at 26 days (PND 54, 7 TCDD doses) were processed and analysed in the same way.
</p>
Blood:</br>
For serum extracts, separation was performed as described above using an Acquity UPLC system (Waters), Ascentis Express column (C18, 5 cm x 2.1 mm, 2.7 µm from Sigma-Aldrich) coupled to a Xevo TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters).

"Data analysis, including peak integration was performed using MAVEN[1][2]. Waters raw data were converted to mzxml format using msconvert in the ProteoWizard Tools[3] prior to analysis by MAVEN. One-way ANOVA was performed in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
