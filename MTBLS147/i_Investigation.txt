STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS147"
Study Title	"Probabilistic networks of blood metabolites in healthy subjects as indicators of latent cardiovascular risk"
Study Description	"The complex nature of the mechanisms behind cardiovascular diseases prevents the detection of latent early risk conditions. Network representations are ideally suited to investigate the complex interconnections between the individual components of a biological system underlying complex diseases. Here we investigate the patterns of correlations of an array of 29 metabolites identified and quantified in the plasma of 864 healthy blood donors and use a systems biology approach to define metabolite probabilistic networks specific for low and high latent cardiovascular risk. We adapted methods based on the likelihood of correlation and methods from information theory and combined them with resampling techniques. Our results show that plasma metabolite networks can be defined that associate with latent cardiovascular disease risk. The analysis of the networks supports our previous finding of a possible association between cardiovascular risk and impaired mitochondrial activity and highlights post-translational modifications (glycosilation and oxidation) of lipoproteins as a possible target-mechanism for early detection of latent cardiovascular risk."

Study Protocol Description	"The subjects that participated in this study were recruited in collaboration with the Tuscan section of the Italian Association of Blood Donors (AVIS) in the Transfusion Service of Pistoia Hospital (Ospedale del Ceppo, AUSL 3, Pistoia, Italy).
</p>
In brief, a total of 864 adult healthy volunteers (678 males, 186 females, mean age 40.87 ± 11.0 years) were enrolled. The overall median age of the subjects is 41 years, with a minimum of 19 years and a 25th percentile of 32 years; 85% of the patients were, at the time of the blood extraction, less than 49 years old.
</p>
Further details for all the protocols can be found in previusly published work [1].

J Proteome Res. 2011 Nov 4;10(11):4983-92. doi:10.1021/pr200452j. PMID:21902250</br>"	"Plasma samples were obtained according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) defined for blood donation in Italy. The samples were obtained after overnight fasting and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as anticoagulant. The presence of EDTA does not affect the quality of the samples: the NMR spectral effects of any interactions between the added EDTA and endogenous components were found to be negligible, thus for plasma samples collected using EDTA as anticoagulant, useful biochemical information can be recovered effectively by metabolomics. The plasma samples for the NMR analysis were obtained from the backup aliquots of samples that, according to the SOPs, are stored in the Transfusion Service for analytical purposes for at least 24 h after blood withdrawal. The plasma samples were stored at -80 °C immediately after collection for further metabonomic analysis."	"Frozen plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and shaken before use. A total of 300 µl of a sodium phosphate buffer was added to 300 µl of each plasma sample, and 450 µl of this mixture was transferred into a 4.25 mm NMR tube (Bruker BioSpin) for analysis."	"1H NMR spectra for all samples were acquired using a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) operating at 600.13 MHz with a 5 mm CPTCI 1H-13C/31P-2H cryo-probe including a z axis gradient coil, an automatic tuning-matching (ATM) and an automatic sample changer.  Before measurement, samples were kept for at least 3 min inside the NMR probehead, for temperature equilibration (310 K)."	"One-dimensional (1-D) spectra of plasma samples were acquired using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG; Bruker) spin-echo sequence to suppresssignals arising from high molecular weight molecules.  Free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential function equivalent to a 1.0 Hz line-broadening factor before applying Fourier transform."	"Transformed spectra were automatically corrected for phase and baseline distortions and calibrated (TMSP peak at 0.00 ppm) using TopSpin (Version 2.1, Bruker). Each 1-D spectrum in the range between 0.02 and 10.00 ppm was segmented into 0.02-ppm chemical shift bins, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using AMIX software(Bruker BioSpin). Regions between 6.0 and 4.5 ppm containing residual water were removed."	"Assignment using AMIX, BBIOREFCODE (Bruker BioSpin) and available literature. The relative concentrations of each metabolites were calculated by integrating the signals in the spectra."
