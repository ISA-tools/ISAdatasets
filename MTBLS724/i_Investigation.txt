STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS724"
Study Title	"Genotype to phenotype: Diet-by-mitochondrial DNA haplotype interactions drive metabolic flexibility and organismal fitness."
Study Description	"Diet may be modified seasonally or by biogeographic, demographic or cultural shifts. It can differentially influence mitochondrial bioenergetics, retrograde signalling to the nuclear genome, and anterograde signalling to mitochondria. All these interactions have the potential to influence the frequencies of mtDNA types in nature and human health. In a model laboratory system, we fed four diets varying in Protein: Carbohydrate (P:C) ratio (1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:16 P:C) to four Drosophila mitotypes and assayed their frequency in population cages. The nuclear genome was standardised. When fed a high protein 1:2 P:C diet, the frequency of flies harbouring Alstonville mtDNA increased. In contrast, when fed the high carbohydrate 1:16 P:C food the incidence of flies harbouring Dahomey mtDNA increased. This result was repeated when the laboratory diet was replaced by natural fruits having high and low P:C ratios and when the nuclear genome was permuted. Quaternary structural modelling, in vitro assays of electron transport chain protein complexes, and protein gels suggested a V161L mutation in the ND4 subunit of Complex I of Dahomey mtDNA was functionally deleterious and resulted in an increase in larval development time on the 1:2 P:C diet. Conversely, the 1:16 P:C diet resulted in an elegant remodelling of energy metabolism and relative reduction in development time of larvae harbouring Dahomey mtDNA. These data question the use of mtDNA as an assumed neutral maker. We posit that humans with specific mtDNA variations may differentially metabolise carbohydrates, which has implications for a variety of first-world diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and perhaps Parkinson’s Disease."

Study Protocol Description	"Drosophila melanogaster lines harboring distinct mitotypes were originally collected in nature (Alstonville, Dahomey) and maintained in cages.
</p>
4 isocaloric Protein:Carbohydrate (P:C) diets were prepared by varying yeast, treacle, semolina and sucrose content in a standard base containing 1% agar, 0.1% nipagen, 0.1% propionic acid and 0.001% phosphoric acid. The P:C ratios were 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:16. The final concentration of ingredients was set at 180 g/l. The 1:2 P:C diet contained 79.4 g of yeast, 73.2 g of semolina, 27.2 g treacle and 0.2 g of sucrose/l (so dietary sucrose comprised ~0.1% of the 1:2 P:C diet). The 1:4 P:C diet contained 46.5 g yeast, 42.4 g semolina, 89.16 g treacle and 1.4 g sucrose/l. The 1:8 P:C diet contained 25.2 g yeast, 23.2 g semolina, 127.5 g treacle and 4.1 g sucrose/l. The 1:16 P:C diet contained 12.9 g of yeast, 11.9 g of semolina, 145.9 g of treacle and 9.3 g sucrose/l (so dietary sucrose comprised ~5% of the 1:16 P:C diet). The autolysed yeast (MP Biomedicals, catalogue no. 103304), contains 45% protein, 24% carbohydrate, 21% indigestible fibre, 8% water and 2% acids, minerals and vitamins. The treacle (CSR, Vic, Australia) contained 0.4% protein, 71% carbohydrate and 0.17% of sodium. The semolina (Quality Food Services, Qld, Australia) contains 11.8% protein, 68.8% carbohydrate, 1.6% fat, 3.2% dietary fibre and 0.0037% sodium. A limitation of these diets is that we could not modify the sugars while maintaining the P:C ratio and caloric content for the high P:C diets.
</p>
The fruit diet was constructed by adding 150 g of passion fruit or banana in a standard base containing 1% agar, 0.1% nipagen, 0.1% propionic acid and 0.001% phosphoric acid. The final volume was set at 300 ml.
</p>
Metabolomics studies were performed on 4 samples groups - each line fed either 1:2 P:C or 1:16 P:C. Approximately 20 mg of female third instar wandering larvae were collected for each analysis."	"Methanol was added to make up each larval sample to 20 mg/ml. Metabolites were extracted using an ultrasonic probe (30 s), 1 hr incubation at 4 °C and then centrifugation to remove particulates. 100 µl aliquots of the supernatant were derivatised as described previously[1].

PMID:10929108</br>"	"GC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent tandem GC/MSD system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) which consisted of a 7683 Series autosampler-injector assembly and a 6890 Agilent GC oven interfaced with a 5973 MSD detector. Chromatographic separation was performed on a 30m SH-RXi-5Sil MS column (Shimadzu, NSW, Australia) with 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 µm film thickness. The oven temperature was programmed at 70 °C for 2 min, then ramped at 15 °C/min to 320 °C, and held 8 min."	"Mass spectrometric data was collected with an Agilent 5973 GC/MSD system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) controlled by Chemstation software. Electron ionisation mass spectra were recorded at 1.4 scans/s over the range m/z 50–700. The MSD auxiliary temperature, source temperature, and quadrupole temperature were set to 280 °C, 230 °C, and 150 °C, respectively."	"No internal standard was employed. Normalisation was performed by maintaining a constant sample mass per volume. Peak areas were log-transformed and statistical analysis used the limma package. Benjamini-Hochberg’s correction was used to control the FDR."	"Analytes were identified using the NIST 2011-Wiley Mass Spectra Library. GC peaks containing mass spectra with a match quality (spectral purity) of more than 70% were considered to be tentatively identified."
