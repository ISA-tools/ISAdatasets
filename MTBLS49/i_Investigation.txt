Study Title	"Metabolomics guides rational development of a simplified cell culture medium for drug screening against Trypanosoma brucei"
Study Description	"In vitro culture methods underpin many experimental approaches to biology and drug discovery. The modification of established cell culture methods to be more biologically relevant, or to optimise growth, is traditionally a laborious task. Emerging metabolomics technology enables rapid evaluation of intra- and extra-cellular metabolites, and can be applied to the rational development of cell culture medium. In this study, untargeted semi-quantitative, and targeted quantitative, metabolomic analyses of fresh and spent media revealed the major nutritional requirements for growth of bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei. The standard culture medium (HMI11) contained unnecessarily high concentrations of 32 nutrients that were subsequently removed to more closely resemble concentrations normally found in blood. Our new minimal medium (CMM) supports in vitro growth equivalent to HMI11, and causes no significant perturbation of metabolite levels for 94% of the detected metabolome (< 3-fold change; a = 0.05). Importantly, improved sensitivity was observed for drug activity studies in whole cell phenotypic screens, and in metabolomics mode of action assays. 400-fold decreases in IC50 were observed for pentamidine and methotrexate, suggesting inhibition of activity by nutrients present in HMI11. CMM is suitable for routine cell culture and offers important advantages for metabolomics studies and drug activity screening."

Study Protocol Description	"Bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei brucei (s427) were cultured in vitro in either HMI11 (Gibco), CMM or modified media with 10% FCS Gold (PAA). Cell culture grade (or high purity) D-glucose, L-cysteine, L-glutamine and all other medium components were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 5 ml cultures were maintained in 25 ml vented flasks (Corning) at 37 ºC with 5% CO2. Cultures were grown to a maximum density of 4 x 106 cells/ml and sub-cultured by 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000 dilution, every 2 or 3 days, respectively. Cell counts were obtained by haemocytometer (Neubauer)."	"Metabolite extraction was performed according to previously described methods [1][2]. 25 ml of cell culture was quenched by rapid cooling to 4 ºC in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 1250 x g for 10 minutes, and 5 µl spent media was removed and extracted by addition of 100 µl chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1). The remaining cell pellet was washed with 1 ml PBS, and the washed pellet (5 × 107 cells) was extracted with 100 µl chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1) by mixing for 1 h at 4 ºC, before centrifugation to remove precipitate. The resulting metabolite solution was stored at -80 ºC until analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Comparative data from HMI11 and CMM cell pellets and spent media are from 5 independent biological replicates.

The LC mobile phase was a linear gradient from 80% B to 20% B over 30 min, followed by an 8 min wash with 5% B, and 8 min re-equilibration with 80% B, where solvent B is 0.08% formic acid in acetonitrile and solvent A is 0.1% formic acid in water. The flow rate was 300 µl/min, column temperature 20 °C, injection volume 10 µl, and samples were maintained at 4 °C."	"The mass spectrometry was performed using an Orbitrap Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, U.K.) with a HESI 2 probe. The spectrometer was operated in polarity switching mode, with the following settings: resolution 50,000, AGC 1 x 106, m/z range 70–1400, sheath gas 40, auxiliary gas 20, sweep gas 1, probe temperature 275 °C, and capillary temperature 250 °C. For positive mode ionization: source voltage +4 kV, capillary voltage +50 V, tube voltage +70 V, skimmer voltage +20 V. For negative mode ionization: source voltage -3.5 kV, capillary voltage -50 V, tube voltage -70 V, skimmer voltage -20 V. Mass calibration was performed for each polarity immediately before each analysis batch, within 48 h for all samples. The calibration mass range was extended to cover small metabolites by inclusion of low-mass contaminants with the standard Thermo calmix masses (below m/z 1400), acetonitrile dimer for positive ion electrospray ionization (PIESI) mode (m/z 83.0604) and C3H5O3 for negative ion electrospray ionization (NIESI) mode (m/z 89.0244). To enhance calibration stability, lock-mass correction was also applied to each analytical run using these ubiquitous low-mass contaminants."	"Peak-picking by XCMS - http://metlin.scripps.edu/xcms/ (Centwave), peak matching and annotation by mzMatch, and noise filtering and metabolite identification by IDEOM (http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/ideom.php), using the default parameters."	"Metabolite identification is based on accurate mass and predicted retention time, which is accepted as a level 3 standard of identification by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI), but should be considered as a putative identification. Retention time was verified by authentic standards for the major HMI11 components and other metabolites where possible."
