Study Title	"Genomic and lipidomic actions of nandrolone on detached rotator cuff muscle in sheep."
Study Description	"Reversal of fatty infiltration of pennate rotator cuff muscle after tendon release is hitherto impossible. The administration of nandrolone starting at the time of tendon release prevents the increase in fat content, but does not revert established fatty infiltration. We hypothesised that tendon release and myotendinous retraction cause alterations in lipid related gene expression leading to fatty muscle infiltration, which can be suppressed by nandrolone through its genomic actions if applied immediately after tendon release. The effects of infraspinatus tendon release and subsequent tendon repair at 16 weeks were studied in six Swiss Alpine sheep. In the interventional groups, 150mg nandrolone was administered weekly after tendon release until sacrifice (N22W, n=6) or starting at the time of repair (N6W, n=6). Infraspinatus volume, composition, expressed transcripts, lipids, and selected proteins were analyzed at baseline, 16 and 22 weeks. Tendon release reduced infraspinatus volume by 22% and increased fat content from 11% to 38%. These changes were not affected by repair. Fatty infiltration was associated with up-regulation of 227 lipid species, and increased levels of the adipocyte differentiation marker PPARG2 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2). Nandrolone abrogated lipid accumulation, halved the loss in fiber area percentage, and up-regulated androgen receptor levels and transcript expression in the N22W but not the N6W group. The results document that nandrolone mitigates muscle-to-fat transformation after tendon release via a general down-regulation of lipid accumulation concomitantly with up-regulated expression of its nuclear receptor and downstream transcripts in skeletal muscle. Reduced responsiveness of retracted muscle to nandrolone as observed in the N6W group is reflected by a down-regulated transcript response."

Study Protocol Description	"Biopsy samples were collected from infraspinatus muscle of sheep before (PRE) and after 16 weeks of tendon release (TR) and 6 weeks of subsequent repair (END) in the operated and contralateral (END-CC) muscle. A group of animals received intramuscular injections of nandrolone starting with the surgery (N22W). In another group injection of nandrolone was started at the time of tendon repair (N6W). The CONTROL group received no nandrolone."	"Lipids were extracted from 5 mg of cryosectioned muscle biopsies using cold MetOH : MTBE : H20 = 360 : 1200 : 348 using a full glass Potter type homogenisator and 10 µl of LysoPC (17:0; Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Sigma) as internal standard based on established protocols[1][2]. The upper (non-polar) phase was recovered after a centrifugation step (5 min at 1000 x g, at 4 °C), collected and stored at -30 °C.

PMID:20433152</br>"	"Prior to analysis the lipid extracts were dried down under a steam of nitrogen and reconstituted in 100 µl of 10 mM ammonium acetate in 80% aqueous methanol. Lipid compounds were separated on nanoAquity UPLC (Waters) equipped with a HSS T3 capillary column (0.2 mm x 150 mm, 1.7 µm particle size, Waters), applying a gradient of 5 µM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile - water 40:60 v/v (A) and 5uM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile - isopropanol 10:90 v/v (B) from 95% A to 2% A. The injection volume was 1 µl."	"The UPLC was coupled to Synapt™ G2 HDMS Hybrid Quadrupole-IMS-TOF Mass Spectrometer (Waters) by a nanoESI source. MS data was acquired using positive polarization and all ion fragmentation (MSE) over a mass range of 80 to 1200 m/z at a resolution of 25,000 (MS and MS/MS). All extractions steps were carried out in dichlormethane-washed Duran glassware. All solvents were of quality HPLC grade (Chromasolv, Sigma)."	"Mass spectrometry data sets were processed with Progenesis QI (Nonlinear Dynamics, A Waters Company)."	"Compound ions were detected and quantified by a multi-step procedure including the retention time (RT) alignment of observed m/z signals, the construction of a consensus m/z - RT map, grouping of co-eluting adducts and quantification of detected compounds through all samples. Detected compound ions were further annotated by database searches based on derived neutral masses, isotopic patterns and the match of observed fragmentation spectra and theoretical fragmentation spectra. Database searches were run with a tolerance of 50 mDa and included LipidMaps (www.lipidmaps.org) and the Human Metabolome Data Base (HMDB, www.hmdb.ca). Each identified compound was allocated its respective Pubchem substance identifier (SID). For multiple hits the compound with the highest score was accepted.
</p>
For the assessment of ion abundance, the mass spectrometry data set was limited to those compounds being detected in all analyzed samples. The total lipid signal was defined as the summed abundance of all ions being detected in one given sample. For each sample, raw signals of each compound were related to the internal LysoPC(17:0) standard."
