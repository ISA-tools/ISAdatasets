Study Protocol Description	"At specified time points mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation. Hole was clipped in trachea, and bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) taken (3 x 1 ml cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) total). 700 µl of sample was used. After SPE column the elute was in 1 ml of methanol. That was then dried down to completion and taken up in 100 µl buffer A (63% H20, 37% ACN, 0.02% Formic Acid). Sample was enriched with 10 ng of each internal standard prior to extraction (100 µl of 26 internal standards from 0.1 ng/µl concentration solution)."	"Briefly, 0.9 ml of BALF samples were supplemented with a mix consisting of 25 deuterated internal standards (Cayman Chemical) and lipid metabolites isolated by solid phase extraction on a Strata X column (Phenomenex)."	"Lipid mediators were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) essentially as described previously [1][2]. The extracted samples were evaporated, reconstituted in a small volume and the eicosanoids were separated by reverse phase LC using a Synergy C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA).
