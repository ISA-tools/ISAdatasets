STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS48"
Study Title	"Evaluation of the toxic effects of municipal wastewater effluent on mice using omic approaches."
Study Description	"Municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE) contain a lot of trace organic pollutants, which will be a threat to environmental health. However, little information is available for the mixed toxicity of MWWE on mammals. In the present study, male mice were exposed to MWWE for 90 days, and then, histopathology and clinical biochemistry determination and transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling were conducted. The results showed that MWWE exposure resulted in injuries in liver and kidney. Combined transcriptomic and metabolomic data demonstrated that MWWE exposure induced perturbations of metabolism, including lipid, nucleotide, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Furthermore, dysregulation of signal transduction processes were also identified based on differentially expressed genes. These results suggested that chronic exposure to MWWE could induce hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in mice and omic approaches are of practical value to evaluate the complex toxicity of MWWE."

Study Protocol Description	"Seven-week-old male mice (Mus musculus, ICR) were purchased from experimental animal centre of Academy of Military Medical Science of China. The mice were housed in stainless-steel cages and acclimated for one week at 25 ± 3 °C, 50 ± 5 % relative humidity, and a 12/12 h light/dark cycle. A total of 20 healthy mice were randomly divided into two groups: the ME group treated with the effluent sample (n = 10) and the control group fed with distilled water (n = 10). The exposure period was 90 days. During exposure, food and water were provided ad libitum. Urine samples were collected over a 24-h period using metabolic cages on day 30, 60 and 90. One milliliter of urine samples were added to 100 μL 0.02% NaN3 on ice, then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and supernatants were stored at -80 °C. After 90 days, all mice were were sacrificed. Serum were collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and stored at -80 °C.
"	"Not applicable."	"For serum samples, 300 µl phosphate sodium buffer (70 mM Na2HPO4; 0.025 (w/v) NaN3; 20% (v/v) D2O; 3 mM sodium trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] proionate (TSP); pH 7.4) was added to 300 µl of each serum sample. This mixture was homogenized and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min and then 550 µl of the supernatants were transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes for analysis.
</p>
For urine samples, 200 µl of sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M Na2HPO4/0.2 M NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) was mixed with 400 µl of urine samples and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Aliquots of the supernatant (500 µl) from each sample were added with 50 µl TSP/D2O (1 mM final concentration) and transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes."	"1H NMR spectra for all samples were acquired using a Bruker AV600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Co., Germany) operating at 600.13 MHz and 298 K."	"Spectra of serum samples were acquired using a Carr-Purcell-Merbom-Gill (CPMG) spin-echo pulse sequence with 32 free induction decays collected into 64k data points. For each urine sample, the spectrum was acquired with a standard pulse sequence (NOESY), using 64 free induction decays (FIDs), 64k data points."	"After Fourier transformed, the phase and baseline of spectra were manually corrected using MestRec software. All the spectra were referenced to TSP (δ = 0.00 ppm). Each spectrum was segmented into 0.005 ppm chemical shift bins corresponding to the range from 0.20 to 10.00 ppm. The region (4.5-5.0 ppm) was excluded to remove the variation in water suppression efficiency. For urine samples, the urea signals (5.0-6.0 ppm) were also removed. Then, all remaining regions were scaled to the total integrated area of the spectra to facilitate comparison among the samples."	"The metabolite resonances were identified according to previous studies (10.1038/msb4100153). Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software was used to identify significantly changed metabolites between the control and treated groups with false discovery rate < 0.01."
