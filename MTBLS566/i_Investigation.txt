STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS566"
Study Title	"Complete pathway elucidation and heterologous reconstitution of Rhodiola salidroside biosynthesis"
Study Description	"Salidroside is a bioactive tyrosine-derived phenolic natural product found in medicinal plants under the Rhodiola genus. In addition to their roles in traditional medicine as anti-fatigue and anti-anoxia adaptogens, Rhodiola total extract and salidroside have also displayed medicinal properties as anti-cardiovascular diseases and anti-cancer agents. The resulting surge in global demand of Rhodiola plants and salidroside has driven some species close to extinction. Here, we report the full elucidation of Rhodiola salidroside biosynthetic pathway utilizing the first comprehensive transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets for Rhodiola rosea. Unlike the previously proposed pathway involving separate decarboxylation and deamination enzymatic steps from tyrosine to the key intermediate 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, Rhodiola contains a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde synthase (4HPAAS) that directly converts tyrosine to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. We further identified genes encoding the subsequent 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde reductase (4HPAR) and tyrosol:UDP-glucose 8-O- glucosyltransferase (T8GT), respectively, to complete salidroside biosynthesis in Rhodiola. We show that heterologous production of salidroside can be achieved in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as in plant Nicotiana benthamiana through transgenic expression of Rhodiola salidroside biosynthetic genes. This study provides new tools for engineering sustainable production of salidroside in heterologous hosts."

Study Protocol Description	"Crown tissue (aerial tissue including leaves and stems) and root tissue were collected separately from a 3-month old greenhouse-grown R. rosea plant."	"Frozen tissue was disrupted with a TissueLyser (Qiagen) using acid-washed metal beads in 50% methanol (500 l/100 mg fresh weight). The extracts were then analyzed by LC-HRAM-MS."	"The extracts were then analyzed by LC-HRAM-MS. A Dionex UltiMate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was coupled to the mass spectrometer. Each sample (2 µl) was injected onto a 150 x 2.1 mm ZIC-pHILIC column (5 µm particle size, EMD Millipore). Solvent A was 20 mM ammonium carbonate, 0.1% ammonium hydroxide; solvent B was acetonitrile. The column oven and autosampler tray were held at 25 °C and 4 °C, respectively. The chromatographic gradient was run at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min as follows: 0–20 min, linear gradient from 80% to 20% solvent B; 20–20.5 min, linear gradient from 20% to 80% solvent B; 20.5–28 min, hold at 80% solvent B."	"Metabolite profiling was conducted on a QExactive benchtop orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with an Ion Max source and a HESI II probe. The mass spectrometer was operated in full-scan, polarity-switching mode with the spray voltage set to 3.0 kV, the heated capillary held at 275 °C, and the HESI probe held at 350 °C. The sheath gas flow was set to 40 units, the auxiliary gas flow was set to 15 units, and the sweep gas flow was set to 1 unit."	"The MS data acquisition was performed in a range of 70–1000 m/z, with the resolution set at 70,000, the AGC target at 10e6, and the maximum injection time at 20 ms. The raw data was converted to mzML format using MSConvert [1], and analyzed using MetaboAnalyst [2] and MZmine2 [3].</br></br>
