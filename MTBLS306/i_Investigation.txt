Study Title	"Metabolomic Profiling of Submaximal Exercise at a Standardised Relative Intensity in Healthy Adults"
Study Description	"Ten physically active subjects underwent two cycling exercise trials. In the first, aerobic capacity (VO2max) was determined and the second was a 45 min submaximal exercise test. Urine samples were collected separately the day before (day 1), the day of (day 2), and the day after (day 3) the submaximal exercise test (12 samples per subject). Metabolomic profiling of the samples was carried out using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) coupled to an Orbitrap Exactive mass spectrometer. Data were extracted, database searched and then subjected to principle components (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares (OPLSDA) modelling. The best results were obtained from pre-treating the data by normalising the metabolites to their mean output on days 1 and 2 of the trial. This allowed PCA to separate the day 2 first void samples (D2S1) from the day 2 post-exercise samples (D2S3) PCA also separated the equivalent samples obtained on day 1 (D1S1 and D1S3). OPLSDA modelling separated both the D2S1 and D2S3 samples and D1S1 and D1S3 samples. The metabolites affected by the exercise samples included a range of purine metabolites and several acyl carnitines. Some metabolites were subject to diurnal variation these included bile acids and several amino acids, the variation of these metabolites was similar on day 1 and day 2 despite the exercise intervention on day 2. Using OPLS modelling it proved possible to identify a single abundant urinary metabolite provisionally identified as oxo-aminohexanoic acid (OHA) as being strongly correlated with VO2max when the levels in the D2S3 samples were considered."

Study Protocol Description	"10 healthy recreationally active adults, 2 female and 8 male, visited the laboratory on 2 separate occasions to complete 2 cycling exercise trials. The first was an incremental exercise test until exhaustion in order to determine aerobic capacity (VO2max) and the second was a 45 min submaximal exercise test. Urine samples were collected the day before, the day of, and the day after the submaximal exercise test. Participants were asked not to exercise 24 hr prior to the maximal test and for the duration of the urine collection period other than the submaximal trial. They were also asked to refrain from the consumption of alcohol 24 hr before each test, caffeine for 6 hr before testing, or consume anything other than water for 3 hr before testing."	"Coded pre-labelled sterilised urine containers were distributed to the subjects. A designated drop-off point was designated for the samples. The unopened urine containers were stored at -20 °C until analysis and were thawed at room temperature and prepared for LC-MS analysis. Urine (200 µl) was thoroughly mixed with 800 µl of ACN, followed by centrifugation at 10000 revolutions per min for 5 min; 800 µl of supernatant was then transferred to a LC auto-sampler vial (Thermo Fisher, UK). The instrumental variation was also minimised by running the 12 samples for each subject in blocks. Since the final normalisation is subject specific, rather than being based on the full cohort this reduces the impact of technical variations in a long run. Samples are designated as follows D = day, S= sample number within a day e.g. D1S1 = day1 sample 1. Pooled samples were interspersed throughout the run to check for technical variation. Within the blocks of 12 the samples the samples were randomised. 4 standard mixtures containing 200 standards were run also after the samples."	"LC-MS data were acquired on an Dionex 3000 HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK) coupled to an Exactive Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific), controlled by Xcalibur version 2.1.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK). The chromatographic separation was performed on a ZIC-pHILIC column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 µm from HiChrom, Reading, UK) in binary gradient mode. The mobile phase used was 20 mM ammonium carbonate buffer (pH 9.2) and pure ACN; the flow rate was 300 µl/min. The gradient was programed as follows: 0 min 20% A 80% B to time 30 min 80% A 20% B. The injection volume was 10 µl and the sample tray temperature was controlled at 12 °C during the measurement."	"LC-MS data were acquired on an Dionex 3000 HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK) coupled to an Exactive Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in both positive and negative mode set at 50,000 resolution, controlled by Xcalibur version 2.1.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK). The mass scanning range was m/z 75–1200, the capillary temperature was 320 °C and the sheath and auxiliary gas flow rates were 50 and 17 arbitrary units, respectively. Samples were run in a stratified method with between subject samples placed in randomised order. MS2 spectra were obtained at 35 V by using an LTQ-Orbitrap under the same conditions described for the Exactive Orbitrap."	"Raw LC-MS files were processed by using m/z Mine 2.14[1].

Graphical representations, tabular features and statistical analysis (p-value generation) were performed in Excel (Microsoft Office 2013). The mean of the peak areas for each metabolite across the samples within each day was calculated and then the area for each metabolite was divided by the mean. This provided a subject-specific normalisation within the non-exercise and exercise days. All subsequent metabolite responses, paired t-test and fold changes (ratio) were conducted on the new data set.

SIMCA-P version 14.0 (Umetrics, Sweden) was used for multivariate analysis which included PCA, OPLS-DA and Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (OPLS). The data were centred, and Pareto scaled for PCA and OPLS-DA and OPLS in order to generate S-plots for visualisation of the components with significant influence in the dataset."
