Study Protocol Description	"All grape berry samples were collected when they reached 18 brix. They were immediately frozen and stored at -80 °C. The skin, pulp and seeds were manually separated and ground under liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C up to extraction."	"All the samples were extracted using a the method of [1] slightly modified. 0.5 g of grape tissue was extracted in 2 ml of methanol/water/chloroform solvents in a ratio 40/20/40 respectively. The samples were agitated for 1 min in vortex, 15 min in an orbital shaker and sonicated for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 5 °C, the upper methanolic/water phase was collected, filtered through 0.22 µm Whatman filters and analyzed by LC-MS.

We used the same method of [1] slightly modified to adapt it to UPLC column. A Waters Acquity UPLC coupled via an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to a Xevo TQ MS (Waters, Manchester, UK). Samples were analysed on a reversed phase (RP) ACQUITY UPLC 1.8 µm 2.1 x 150 mm C18 column (Waters) at 40 °C during the analysis. Water with 0.1% formic acid (eluent A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% FA (eluent B). The gradient was as follows: starting from 95% of A, to 20% of B in 3 min; isocratic flow up to 4.3 min, and then ramping to 45% of B at 9 min. Then 100% of B at 11 min, holding up to 13 min, and then returning to the initial conditions of 95% of A for a total run of 17 min.

We used the same method of [2]. A Waters Acquity UPLC coupled via an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to a Synapt HDMS QTOF MS (Waters, Manchester, UK) operating in W-mode and controlled by MassLynx 4.1 was used. Samples were analysed on a reversed phase (RP) ACQUITY UPLC 1.8 µm 2.1 x 150 mm HSS T3 column (Waters) protected with an Acquity UPLC® BEH HSS T3 1.8 µm, 2.1 x 5 mm precolumn (Waters), at 40 °C during the analysis. Flow rate = 0.28 ml/min. Gredient: Total run = 28 min. Start with 100% eluent A (H2O 0.1% Formic acid), switch to 10% eluent B at 1.5 min (MeOH 0.1% Formic acid), up to 40% B in 18 min, then up to 100% B at 21 min, 100% B up to 25.5 min, then back to 100% A to requilibrate the column.

We used the same method of [1]. Mass spectrometry instrument used was TQ-MS (ESI-QqQ-MS) WATERS. We targeted the signals of catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin-gallate, epigallo-catechin-gallate, Procyanidin B1, and Procyanidin B2. Furthermore, we targeted the resullting products of the phloroglucinolysis (PHL) assay: catechin-PHL, epicatechin-PHL, epicatechin-gallate-PHL, epigallocatechin-PHL.
</p>
Untargeted:</br>
We used the same method of [2]. Mass spectrometry instrument used was Synapt HDMS QTOF-MS (ESI-Q-TOF-MS) WATERS. Spectra were collected in positive ESI mode over a mass range of 50–2000 amu with a scan duration of 0.3 s in centroid mode. The transfer collision energy and trap collision energy were set at 6 and 4 V. The source parameters were set as follows: capillary 3 kV, sampling cone 25 V, extraction cone 3 V, source temperature 150°C, desolvation temperature 500 °C, desolvation gas flow 1000 l/h and nebulizer gas 50 l/h. External calibration with sodium formate and Lock Mass calibration with leucine enkephaline solution (0.5 mg/l, m/z 556.2771 at 0.1 ml/min) was applied.

MSI level 1 of identification was achieved injecting pure chemical standards under the same analytical conditions. MSI level 2 and 3 were achieved through formula calculation, MS/MS spectra acquisition and quering in MetFRAG or MetFursion.
