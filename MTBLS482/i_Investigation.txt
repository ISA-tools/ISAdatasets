STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS482"
Study Title	"Effects of a Compound from the Group of Substituted Thiadiazines with Hypothermia Inducing Properties on Brain Metabolism in Rats, a Study In Vivo and In Vitro"
Study Description	"The aim of the present study was to examine how administration of a compound of 1,3,4-thiadiazine class 2-morpholino-5-phenyl-6H-1,3,4-thiadiazine hydrobromide (L-17) with hypothermia inducing properties affects the brain metabolism. The mechanism by which L-17 induces hypothermia is unknown; it may involve hypothalamic central thermoregulation as well as act via inhibition of energy metabolism. We tested the hypothesis that L-17 may induce hypothermia by directly inhibiting energy metabolism. The study in vivo was carried out on Sprague-Dawley adult rats. Two doses of L-17 were administered (190 mg/kg and 760 mg/kg). Brain metabolites were analyzed in control and treated groups using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, along with blood flow rate measurements in carotid arteries and body temperature measurements. Further in vitro studies on primary cultures from rat hippocampus were carried out to perform a mitochondria function test of L-17 pre-incubation (100 µM, 30 min). Analysis of brain metabolites showed no significant changes in 190 mg/kg treated group along with a significant reduction in body temperature by 1.5 °C. However, administration of L-17 in higher dose 760 mg/kg provoked changes in brain metabolites indicative of neurotoxicity as well as reduction in carotid arteries flow rate. In addition, a balance change of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters was observed. The L-17 pre-incubation with cell primary cultures from rat brain showed no significant changes in mitochondrial function. The results obtained in the study indicate that acute administration of L-17 190 mg/kg in rats induces mild hypothermia with no adverse effects onto brain metabolism."

Study Protocol Description	"For the spectroscopy studies 18 Sprague-Dawley male rats aged from 12 to 13 wks were used. Body temperature was measured with implantable temperature data loggers (model TDL3-28, EMBI RESEARCH LLC, Novosibirsk, Russia, 0.8 g, 5 min recording interval, accuracy 0.1 °C), which were implanted into the abdomen under isoflurane anesthesia a week before and were fixed for the whole duration of the experiment (16 Sprague-Dawley rats). Animals were housed in individually ventilated cages, with 1 animal per cage. The cages had a height of 20.5 cm and an area of 929 cm^2 (OptiRAT cage; Charles River Laboratories). Water and Chara SPF granulated forage for laboratory rodents (Assortiment-Agro, Puschino, Russia) were given ad libitum. Rodents were kept in artificial day-night regime (14-hr light/10-hr darkness), at a temperature of 22 to 24 °C, and humidity of 40 to 50%. Dry dedusted wood shavings (Albion, Novosibirsk, Russia) were used as litter. The food and litter were autoclaved before use. Drinking water was deionized with a Millipore NF-C8674 (Merck Millipore) and supplemented with Severyanka mineral additive (Eko-proect, St. Petersburg, Russia)."	"All medications were intraperitoneally injected 2 hr prior to magnetic resonance imaging studies.</br>
1. Control group (physiologic saline) (N = 7).</br>
2. Low dose L17 (190 mg/kg) (N = 7).</br>
3. High dose L17 (760 mg/kg) (N = 4).
</p>
Measurements of blood parameters and neurometabolites were carried out on a horizontal tomograph with a magnetic field of 11.7 Tesla (Bruker, Biospec 117/16 USR, Germany). Diameter and volumetric flow rate of carotid arteries, and metabolites levels of rat’s cerebral cortex were measured using 1H radio frequency coils.
</p>
Rats were immobilized with a gas anesthesia (Isofluran; Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL) using a Univentor 400 Anesthesia Unit (Univentor, Zejtun, Malta). The animal body temperature was maintained with a water circuit installed into the table bed of the tomograph, which was maintained at 30 °C on its surface. A pneumatic respiration sensor (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY) was placed under the lower body part, which allowed for the control of anesthesia depth."	"The spectra of rat cerebral cortex were acquired on a Bruker BioSpec 117/16 USR horizontal tomograph using transmitter volume (500.3 MHz; distribution, 72/89 mm) and receiver surface (500.3 MHz; 123 x 64 x 31 mm) 1 H radiofrequency coils."	"High-resolution T2-weighted images of the rat brain (section thickness, 0.5 mm; field of view, 2.5 x 2.5 mm; matrix, 256 x 256 dots) were recorded by RARE (rapid with relaxation enhancement) with the pulse sequence parameters TE = 11 ms and TR = 2.5 s for the correct positioning of the spectroscopic voxels (1.6 x 4.0 x 3.0 mm).
</p>
All proton spectra were recorded by spatially localized single-voxel STEAM (stimulated echo acquisition mode) spectroscopy with the pulse sequence parameters TE = 3 ms and TR = 5 s and 100 accumulations. Uniformity of the magnetic field was tuned within the selected voxel using FastMap (Bruker) before each spectroscopic recording. The water signal was inhibited with a variable pulse power and optimized relaxation delays (VAPOR) sequence."	"The experimental 1H magnetic resonance spectra were processed and the quantitative composition of metabolites was determined with an original specialized program developed in our laboratory[1] similar to the LCModel software package[2], assuming that the spectrum of a mixture of known compounds is a linear combination of analyzed components.
