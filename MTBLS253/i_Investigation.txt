Study Title	"Metabolic characterization of the natural progression of chronic hepatitis B (Oxylipin assay)."
Study Description	"Background: Worldwide, over 350 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and are at increased risk of developing progressive liver diseases. The confinement of HBV replication to the liver, which also acts as the central hub for metabolic and nutritional regulation, emphasizes the interlinked nature of host metabolism and the disease. Still, the metabolic processes operational during the distinct clinical phases of a chronic HBV infection—immune tolerant, immune active, inactive carrier, and HBeAg-negative hepatitis phases—remains unexplored. </p> Methods: To investigate this, we conducted a targeted metabolomics approach on serum to determine the metabolic progression over the clinical phases of chronic HBV infection, using patient samples grouped based on their HBV DNA, alanine aminotransferase, and HBeAg serum levels. </p> Results: Our data illustrate the strength of metabolomics to provide insight into the metabolic dysregulation experienced during chronic HBV. The immune tolerant phase is characterized by the speculated viral hijacking of the glycerol-3-phosphate–NADH shuttle, explaining the reduced glycerophospholipid and increased plasmalogen species, indicating a strong link to HBV replication. The persisting impairment of the choline glycerophospholipids, even during the inactive carrier phase with minimal HBV activity, alludes to possible metabolic imprinting effects. The progression of chronic HBV is associated with increased concentrations of very long chain triglycerides together with citrulline and ornithine, reflective of a dysregulated urea cycle peaking in the HBV envelope antigen-negative phase. </p> Conclusions: The work presented here will aid in future studies to (i) validate and understand the implication of these metabolic changes using a thorough systems biology approach, (ii) monitor and predict disease severity, as well as (iii) determine the therapeutic value of the glycerol-3-phosphate–NADH shuttle. </p> The Lipid assays and the Biogenic amine and Acyl-carnitine assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights studies MTBLS279 and MTBLS280 respectively."

Study Protocol Description	"Study population:</br>
69 chronic HBV patients and 19 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this discovery study. Blood was prospectively collected in SST tubes at the Erasmus MC and centrifuged to separate the serum and stored at -80 °C until analysis. Patients were treatment naïve and excluded if they had other chronic infections (HIV, hepatitis C virus) or a body mass index of 31 or more. This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The ethical review board of the Erasmus MC approved the study and informed consent was obtained from all patients who were asked to donate blood.
</p>
Definition of chronic HBV clinical phases:</br>
Serum ALT was measured on an automated analyzer, qualitative serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBeAg, and anti-HBeAg antibodies (Abs) were measured on an Architect Abbott analyzer, and serum HBV DNA levels were measured using the COBAS AmpliPrep-COBAS Taq- Man HBVv2test (CAP-CTM; Roche Molecular Systems, Indianapolis, IN). Based on serum HBV DNA, ALT levels and HBeAg presence at the time of sampling, patients were categorized into four clinical HBV phases according to international guidelines[1]. Immune tolerant (IT, n=18) patients had detectable serum HBeAg and repetitive normal ALT values (<40 U/l). The HBeAg-positive immune active (IA, n=12) and HBeAg-negative (ENEG, n=19) patients had repetitive or intermittent abnormal serum ALT (>40 U/l) values, and HBV DNA levels >2,000 IU/ml. Inactive carrier (IC, n=20) patients were HBeAg-negative and had both repetitive normal ALT values (<40 IU/l) and HBV DNAllevels below 20,000 IU/ml.</br>
Note: A Unit (U)/litre(l) (SI unit) is equivalent to an International (IU)/litre(l) (US unit)[2]
</p>
Quality control samples:</br>
Quality control (QC) samples consisted of equally pooled volumes of all study samples. A set of QC samples was then included during the analyses of the experimental groups on the individual metabolomic platforms and evenly distributed through the randomized samples prior to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analyses. In addition, independent duplicate samples (10–15%) were randomly selected where sample volume allowed.

[2] SI to US units conversion.pdf, included with this study.</br>"	"Antioxidant mixture (5 µl) (0.4 mg/ml BHT and 0.4 mg/ml EDTA mixed with volume ratio 1:1) and a mixture of internal-standard mixtures (ISTDs) (5 µl, 1000 nM) were added into each 250 µl aliquot of human plasma. Subsequently the samples were loaded on the activated SPE plates (Oasis-HLB 96-well plates, 60 mg, 30 µm) and eluted using ethyl acetate (1.5 ml). The dried eluate was re-dissolved in 50 µl acetonitrile/methanol (50:50 v/v) and 5 µl were used for HPLC analysis."	"Separation was done by HPLC (Agilent 1290, San Jose, CA, USA) using an Ascentis® Express column (2.1 x 150 mm, 2.7 µm particles; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) with 0.35 ml flow during 28 min gradient."	"The HPLC was coupled to electrospray ionization on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent 6460, San Jose, CA, USA). Oxylipins were detected in negative ion mode using dynamic Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)."	"Peak areas were exported from Mass Hunter software (Agilent Technologies, version B.05.01) and ratios to internal standards were computed (target compounds/ISTDs). Subsequently, an in-house developed QC tool was used to correct for instrument drift and batch effects. The reliability of the measurements was assessed by calculating the reproducibility of each metabolite in a QC pool, which was measured after every 10 samples. 30 unique oxylipins out of a target list of 110 oxylipins included in the metabolomics platform met the criteria RSD-QC <35%."	"MRM transitions were achieved by flow injection of pure standards and the optimizer application and were compared to literature. Then the MRM transitions were used for identification of each compound. 
</p>
The data was subjected to Anova and K-means pattern analyses."
