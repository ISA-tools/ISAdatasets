Study Title	"PROMIS, global analysis of PROtein-Metabolite Interactions using Size separation in Arabidopsis thaliana"
Study Description	"Small molecules not only represent cellular building blocks and metabolic intermediates, but also regulatory ligands and signaling molecules that interact with proteins. Although these interactions affect cellular metabolism, growth, and development, they have been largely understudied. Herein, we describe a method, dubbed PROtein-Metabolite Interactions using Size separation (PROMIS) that allows simultaneous, global analysis of endogenous protein-small molecule and of protein‒protein complexes. To this end, a cell-free native lysate from Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, followed by quantitative metabolomic and proteomic analyses. Proteins and small molecules showing similar elution behavior, across protein containing fractions, constituted putative interactors. Applying PROMIS to an A. thaliana extract, we ascertained known protein‒protein (PPIs) and protein-metabolite (PMIs) interactions and reproduced binding between small-molecule protease inhibitors and their respective proteases. More importantly, we present examples of two experimental strategies that exploit the PROMIS dataset to identify novel PMIs. By looking for similar elution behavior of metabolites and enzymes belonging to the same biochemical pathways, we identified putative feedback and feed-forward regulations in pantothenate biosynthesis and the methionine salvage cycle, respectively. By combining PROMIS with an orthogonal affinity purification approach, we identified an interaction between the dipeptide Tyr-Asp and the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In summary, we present proof of concept for a powerful experimental tool that enables system-wide analysis of PMIs and PPIs across all biological systems. The dataset obtained here comprises nearly 140 metabolites and 5000 proteins, which can be mined for putative interactors."

Study Protocol Description	"Cell suspension culture of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0), derived from MM2d cells[1] was grown in MSMO medium, in continuous photoperiod, at 21 °C, on orbital shaker (110-120 rpm). MSMO medium: 4.43 g/l of Murashige & Skoog Basal salts with minimal organics (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 30 g/l of sucrose, 0.5 mg/l of 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, 0.05 mg/l of kinetin, pH 5.7, adjusted with 1 M KOH. Cells were harvested at the logarithmic growth phase (7 days after last passage) by filtration and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Experiments were conducted using 4 independently inoculated, grown, harvested, and extracted cultures.

PMID:25521792</br>"	"Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed at 4 °C as previously described[1]. 2.5 ml of soluble fraction corresponding to 50 mg of protein, as determined by Bradford assay, were used for the separations. SEC was performed with a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 prep grade column (GE Healthcare Life Science, Little Chalfont, UK) connected to an ÄKTA explorer 10 (GE Healthcare Life Science, Little Chalfont, UK) operating at 4 °C. The flow rate was set to 0.8 ml/min. 57 fractions of 1.5 ml were collected from 40 to 125.5 ml elution volume of which 1 ml was dried in a speed-vac overnight and stored at −80 °C for metabolomic analysis. For the protein free control experiment, 50 mg of protein of the soluble fraction was precipitated with 80% acetone at −20 °C for 5 h. After pelleting denatured proteins by centrifugation at 3452 x g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was dried overnight in a speed-vac. Small molecules were resuspended the next day in the original volume of lysis buffer and used for SEC.
</p>
Metabolites were extracted from SEC fractions as previously described[1]. Briefly, collected fractions were extracted using Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/Methanol/Water solvent system to separate proteins, lipids, and polar compounds into pellet, organic, and aqueous phase, respectively[2]. After extraction, the aqueous phase was dried in a speed-vac and stored at −80 °C until LC/MS analysis.

Briefly, UPLC separation was performed using a Waters Acquity UPLC system (Waters), using an HSS T3 C18 reversed-phase column (100 mm x 2.1 mm x 1.8 μm particles; Waters). The mobile phases were 0.1% formic acid in H2O (Buffer A, ULC MS grade; BioSolve) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (Buffer B, ULC MS grade; BioSolve). A 2 μl sample (the dried-down aqueous fraction was re-suspended in 100 μl of UPLC grade water) was loaded per injection, and the gradient, which was taken out with a flow rate of 400 μl/min, was: 1 min 99% A, 13 min linear gradient from 99% A to 65% A, 14.5 min linear gradient from 65% A to 30% A, 15.5 min linear gradient from 30% A to 1% A, hold 1% A until 17 min, 17.5 min linear gradient from 1% A to 99% A, and re-equilibrate the column for 2.5 min (20 min total run time).

Processing of mass spectrometry data included retention time alignment, peak detection, removal of the isotopic peaks, as well as chemical noise. Obtained metabolic features (m/z at a given retention time) were queried against an in-house reference compound database allowing 0.15 min retention time and 3 ppm m/z deviation. For metabolites that showed a higher ppm error in standard compound measurements we allowed a corresponding deviation of up to 10 ppm."	"All features were matched to an in-house library of authentic standards allowing retention time deviations of 0.05 min and m/z deviation of 0.002. In addition a replicate extract of one experiment was analyzed by MetaSysX GmbH (MetaSysX GmbH, Potsdam, Germany) using identical chromatographic settings and annotations were transferred to in-house measured data by estimating the RT shifts over the chromatogram following the most abundant feature in every 0.05 min window. The higher number of annotations reported here in comparison to those previously described[1] results from the growth of our standard library e.g. as a result of incorporation of 400 dipeptide standards.  Granting the request of MetaSysX, RT information was removed from the Supplement but will be shared upon inquiry.
