Study Title	"Absolute quantification of metabolites in tomato fruit extracts by fast 2D NMR (Tomato 700 MHz samples)"
Study Description	"Quantitative NMR metabolomics is a powerful tool to have access to valuable information on metabolism. Unfortunately, the quantitative analysis of metabolic samples is often hampered by peak overlap. Two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy offers a promising alternative and quantitative results can be obtained provided that a calibration approach is employed. However, the duration of 2D NMR experiments is barely compatible with the metabolomic study of a large number of samples. This drawback can be circumvented by relying on “ultrafast” experiments capable of recording 2D spectra in a single-scan. While such experiments are not sensitive enough to match the concentrations of metabolic samples, a compromise can be reached by hybrid strategies capable of recording 2D NMR spectra of extracts in a few minutes only. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that these multi-scan single-shot experiments can be successfully applied to the absolute quantification of major metabolites in plant extracts. Fast COSY experiments are recorded in 5 min on tomato fruit pericarp extracts at different stages of development. The concentration of eight major metabolites is determined with a trueness better than 10 % and a technical repeatability of a few percent. The experiments performed at two magnetic fields lead to similar quantitative results, in coherence with the metabolism of tomato fruit. The results show that fast 2D NMR methods form a promising tool for fast targeted metabolomics, and open promising perspective towards the automated and high-throughput quantitative analysis of large groups of plant and other samples for metabolomics and for the modelling of metabolism."

Study Protocol Description	"Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Moneymaker) were grown in a glass greenhouse in South-West of France in optimal commercial conditions as described previously [1]. The fruit were harvested at four different stages of development: 8, 21, 34 and 55 days post anthesis (DPA) on three different trusses (truss 5, 6, and 7). Eight DPA corresponds to the cell division stage, 21 DPA to the cell expansion stage, 34 DPA to the transition between cell expansion and ripening and 55 DPA to red-ripe fruit. Each biological replicate was made up of 4–5 fruits harvested on different plants. Three biological replicates, corresponding to the three different trusses, were used for each stage of the development. A quarter of the fruit pericarp from the equatorial zone was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fruit pericarp samples were ground in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until freeze-drying. An aliquot of fresh frozen powder was lyophilized and used for NMR analyses.

PMID:24474652</br>"	"Each extract was prepared from 40 mg (2 aliquots of 20 mg each) of lyophilized powder using a robotised Starlet platform (Hamilton, Villebon sur Yvette, France).  The metabolic extraction was performed in four steps. After weighing 20 mg, 300 µl of EtOH/water (80/20, v/v) solution were added to each sample in a 1.1 ml Micronics tube, then the mixture was checked and put in a hot water bath at 80 °C during 10 min and finally placed in a centrifuge at 4,000 x g during 5 min. The supernatant was transferred into a 1.4 ml Micronics tube. The 1.1 ml Micronics tube containing the pellet was submitted to three other extraction steps: same solvent mixture, then EtOH/water (50/50, v/v), and pure Milli-Q water for the last step. The supernatants from the two aliquots and four steps were combined and evaporated to dryness using a vacuum evaporator (SpeedVac Savant,  Asheville, USA). The dried extracts were titrated with KOD to pH 6 using a titration unit BTpH (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) in 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution in D2O containing 2 mM EDTA. Then, trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate sodium salt (TSP, 0.01% final concentration for chemical shift calibration) was added. Titrated extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized during 12 h."	"Just before the NMR acquisition, 600 µl of deuterium oxide (D2O; 99.90%D, Eurisotop, Saint Aubin, France) containing sodium azide (NaN3, 3.85 mM final concentration, in order to avoid bacterial contamination) were added to the dried titrated extracts, and the solubilized titrated extract was transferred into a 5 mm NMR Wilmad LabGlass tube of 7 inches (Wilmad, Vineland, USA)."	"All the NMR spectra of the tomato fruit extract samples were recorded three times at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III HD 700 spectrometer operating at a frequency of 700.13 MHz with an inverse 1H/13C/15N/2H cryogenically cooled probe."	"For each experiment, the 90° pulse width was carefully calibrated and the water signal at 4.7 ppm was presaturated by continuous irradiation during the recovery delay. All experiments by ultrafast NMR were performed under partial saturation conditions, with TR = 5 s. All the ultrafast COSY experiments were recorded using the pulse sequence described previously [1], including the possibility to perform interleaved acquisitions. The final spectral width was 5 ppm (F2) x 5.4 ppm (F1) at 700 MHz. The experiment duration is given by Ta = NS•N1 where NS is the number of scans and N1 the number of interleaved acquisitions. For the experiments performed at 700 MHz, the following parameters were used: NS = 16 and N1 = 4. Due to high magnetic field, interleaving was required to sample the same spectral width as on a 500 MHz spectrometer. The experiment duration was kept constant by reducing the number of scans thanks to the highest sensitivity of the 700 MHz spectrometer. All the experiments were eventually performed with a ca. 5 min overall duration. For all the experiments, the spatial encoding was performed with two successive smoothed chirp pulses (60 kHz, 15 ms) applied together with 8.3 G/cm bipolar spatial encoding gradients. The mixing period included opposite coherence-selection gradients (sin shape; 58.5 G/cm, 0.8 ms). For the acquisition, 128 acquisition gradient pairs were applied, with the following amplitude and duration: 58.5 G/cm and 256 µs. The amplitude and duration of the pre-acquisition gradient were adapted to center the chemical shift range of interest in the middle of the detection window in the spatially encoded dimension.

PMID:24322368</br>"	"Before Fourier Transformation, 2D FIDs were weighed with apodization functions leading to the optimum sensitivity for the relevant peaks. A sinebell function was applied in the conventional dimension of all the experiments. In the ultrafast dimension, an apodization was performed in the spatial dimension with optimized gaussian apodization functions designed according to a recently described procedure [1]. The conventional spectra were zero-filled in both dimensions and the ultrafast spectra were zero-filled in the conventional dimension.
</p>
All the spectra were processed in the magnitude mode. Finally, a second order automatic baseline correction was applied in the two dimensions of the 2D spectra.
The specific processing for the ultrafast spectra (as described in [2]) was performed using a home-written routine in TopSpin (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany. All the pulse sequences and processing programs described in this paper are available on request.

PMID:15369377</br>"	"Eight major polar compounds of tomato flesh, belonging to several metabolite families and implicated in fruit growth and quality, were selected for quantification. After annotation, the most isolated peak was selected for each compound. The peak volumes were measured using the 2D integration tool in TopSpin 3.1 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). The integration region limits were optimized for each peak of interest on the highest concentrated mixture. Integration regions were centered on the peak of interest and their size was chosen as large as possible to integrate the whole peak but small enough to avoid overlap with neighbouring peaks. Identical integration regions were used for all the samples.
</p>
To evaluate the repeatability of the NMR quantification procedure, each spectrum (calibration and biological extracts) was acquired three successive times, and average values were calculated for each peak volume. Calibration curves were then fitted by the linear regression equation: V = a•[m] + b, where V represents the 2D peak volume (arbitrary unit, a.u.) and [m] is the concentration (in millimoles per litre) of the given metabolite in the calibration sample.
</p>
To determine the unknown concentration of the eight metabolites in the twelve tomato pericarp extracts, the volume of each target peak was measured with the same integration file as for the calibration samples, and the concentration was determined using the linear regression equation of the corresponding metabolite. (Calibration Standards available at MTBLS134)."
