Study Title	"Global Metabolomic Profiling of Mice Brains following Experimental Infection with the Cyst-Forming Toxoplasma gondii"
Study Description	"The interplay between the Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii and its host has been largely studied. However, molecular changes at the metabolic level in the host central nervous system and pathogenesis-associated metabolites during brain infection are largely unexplored. We used a global metabolomics strategy to identify differentially regulated metabolites and affected metabolic pathways in BALB/c mice during infection with T. gondii Pru strain at 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection (DPI). The non-targeted Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics analysis detected approximately 2,755 retention time-exact mass pairs, of which more than 60 had significantly differential profiles at different stages of infection. These include amino acids, organic acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and vitamins. The biological significance of these metabolites is discussed. Principal Component Analysis and Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis showed the metabolites’ profile to change over time with the most significant changes occurring at 14 DPI. Correlated metabolic pathway imbalances were observed in carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, energetic metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. Eight metabolites correlated with the physical recovery from infection-caused illness were identified. These findings indicate that global metabolomics adopted in this study is a sensitive approach for detecting metabolic alterations in T. gondii-infected mice and generated a comparative metabolic profile of brain tissue distinguishing infected from non-infected host."

Study Protocol Description	"6 to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 6 per group) were either left uninfected or inoculated orally with freshly prepared 10 cysts of Toxoplasma gondii type II Prugniuad (Pru) strain parasites using a small gavage needle. Body weight was measured daily for 21 days post-infection (DPI), and all the mice were checked daily for the development of clinical signs characteristics of toxoplasmosis. 6 mice from each of infected and control groups were sacrificed at 7, 14 and 21 DPI respectively."	"Unbiased metabolomic profiles of brain samples were obtained by using High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (HPLC-MS). To minimize any potential changes to the tissue metabolome, mice forebrains were rapidly removed and flash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C until processing. Nearly 100 mg sample was homogenized in 500 µl of a solvent of acetonitrile-water (7:3), treated with ultrasonic waves for 15 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, at 4 °C. Supernatant (200 µl) was transferred to a new 1.5 ml polypropylene tube before liquid chromatography separation."	"The Agilent 1290 Infinity LC System coupled to an Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) (LC-Q/TOF-MS) was run in a binary gradient solvent mode consisting of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid/water (solvent A) and 0.1% (v/v) formic/methanol (solvent B). The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. A C18 column (Agilent Technologies, Santa, Clara, CA) (1.8 µm, 100 x 2.1 mm) was used for all subsequent analysis. The linear gradient was as follows: 5% B at 0 min, 5% B at 2 min, 95% B at 17 min, and 95% B at 19 min."	"Sample analysis was carried out in both positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) and negative ion (ESI ) modes. The column temperature was 45 °C and the injection volume was 5 µl. LC-MS data was acquired using an Agilent 1290 Infinity LC System coupled to an Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass Quadrupole Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer. The mass scan range was 100-1000 m/z. For positive ion mode, the capillary and cone voltage were set at 4 kV and 35 kV, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the dry gas. The desolvation gas was set to 600 l/h at 350 °C; the cone gas was set to 50 l/h and the source temperature was set to 100 °C. For negative ion mode, the capillary and cone voltage were set at 3.5kV and 50 kV, respectively. The desolvation gas was set to 700 l/h at 300 °C; the cone gas was set to 50 l/h and the source temperature was set to 100 °C. The mass spectrometry was operated in V optics mode and the data acquisition rate was set to 0.03 s, with interscan delay of 0.02 s. To ensure accuracy and reproducibility LockSpray was used in all analyses and Leucine-enkephalin was selected as the lockmass."	"Agilent MassHunter Workstation QTOF Acquistition software (B.03.01) was used for data acquisition. LC-MS raw data files were converted into conmmon format (.mzdata), which was followed by data processing through the XCMS toolbox (http://metlin.scripps.edu/xcms/). Peak picking, peak grouping and retention time correction were all involved in data pre-treatment, which were done through the XCMS software that was implemented with the freely available R statistical language (v 2.13.1).
</p>
The retention time (RT)-m/z data pairs were used to indentify ion intensities of those detected peaks. The consistent variables (ion intensity information) were obtained by filtering peaks with 80 % missing values. In order to remove the offsets and adjust the importance of high and low abundance metabolites to an equal level, the data was preprocessed by both mean-centering and variance-scaling prior to multivariate analysis. Then, the resulting three-dimensional matrix that includes assigned peak indices (retention time-m/z pairs), sample names and variables further went through the multivariate data analysis."	"Putative metabolites were first derived by searching the exact molecular mass data from redundant m/z peaks against the online HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/), METLIN (http://metlin.scripps.edu/) and KEGG (www.genome.jp/kegg/) databases. A specific metabolite was sieved out when a match with a difference between observed and theoretical mass was less than 10 ppm. Then the metabolite molecular formula of matched metabolites was further identified by the isotopic distribution measurement."
