STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS360"
Study Title	"Metabolomics and lipidomics reveal perturbation of sphingolipid metabolism by a novel anti-trypanosomal 3-(oxazolo[4,5-b]pyridine-2-yl)anilide"
Study Description	"Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis, which is responsible for thousands of deaths every year. Current therapies are limited and there is an urgent need to develop new drugs. The anti-trypanosomal compound, 3-(oxazolo[4,5-b]pyridine-2-yl)anilide (OXPA), was initially identified in a phenotypic screen and subsequently optimized by structure–activity directed medicinal chemistry. It has been shown to be non-toxic and to be active against a number of trypanosomatid parasites. However, nothing is known about its mechanism of action."

Study Protocol Description	"T.b. brucei bloodstream forms were cultured in Creeks minimal media (CMM) containing additional 100 lM hypoxanthine[1] and 5 ml cultures maintained in a 25 ml vented flask (Corning) at 37 °C with 10% CO2. The cultures were grown to a maximum density of 2 x 10^6 cells/ml and sub-cultured every 2 or 3 days. Cell density was measured with a Neubauer hemocytometer. Growth curves were obtained in the presence of 5 times the IC50 concentration of OXPA (0.85 µM) to confirm that this is a sub-lethal concentration for 5 h treatment[1].
</p>
For metabolomics and lipidomics studies, a confluent cell culture was sub-cultured into fresh medium at 1 x 10^5 cells/ml, and OXPA (0.85 µM) or 4 µl DMSO (vehicle control) was added to flasks when cell density reached approximately 8 x 10^5 cells/ml. Cultures were further incubated for 5 h (cell density reached 1 x 10^6 cells/ml) and samples, including the controls, were quenched and extracted. 4 independent biological replicates were prepared on separate days.

A volume of 40 ml of cell culture was quenched by rapid cooling to 4 °C in a dry ice ethanol bath. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 1250 x g for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered-saline. The washed pellet, containing 4 x 10^7 cells was extracted with 100 µl chloroform:methanol:water (1:3:1 v/v) with periodic sonication and mixing for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation to remove the precipitate. The resulting metabolite solution was stored at -80 °C until analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Chromatography was performed using a ZIC-HILIC 150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 µm column (Merck Sequant) with ammonium carbonate and acetonitrile in the mobile phase[1]. Parameters for the HPLC analysis were applied as previously described[2].

Parameters for the MS analysis were applied as previously described[1]. Briefly, the spectrometer was operated in polarity switching mode, with the following settings: resolution 50,000, AGC 1 x 10^6, m/z range 70–1400, sheath gas 40, auxiliary gas 20, sweep gas 1, probe temperature 275 °C, and capillary temperature 250 °C. For positive mode ionization: source voltage +4 kV, capillary voltage +50 V, tube voltage +70 V, skimmer voltage +20 V. For negative mode ionization: source voltage -3.5 kV, capillary voltage -50 V, tube voltage -70 V, skimmer voltage -20 V. Mass calibration was performed for each polarity immediately before each analysis batch, within 48 hr for all samples.

PMID:21928819</br>"	"Raw LC–MS data were processed with a combination of XCMS Centwave for peak picking (http://metlin.scripps.edu/xcms/) and mzMatch for alignment and annotation of related peaks (http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/)."	"Metabolomics data analysis was performed with the freely available software packages mzMatch and IDEOM (http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/ideom.php) as previously described[1]. Briefly, metabolite mixes containing 226 authentic metabolites were used to verify retention times and aid metabolite identification. Identification with those standards leads to a high confidence identification (MSI level 1) and these metabolites are highlighted yellow in the supplementary IDEOM file. Putative identification of all other
metabolites was carried out by exact mass and predicted retention times from all metabolites from KEGG, Lipidmaps and MetaCyc databases[2]. Metadata supporting the putative identification of each metabolite, and the associated metabolite identifiers are available in the supplementary
IDEOM files which can be viewed in Excel. Relative quantification for the analysis is based on mean peak height and statistical analysis used unpaired Welch’s T test. The data was not normalized, and signal reproducibilitywas ensured by the analysis of four spiked internal standards (CHAPS, TRIS, PIPES andCAPS), total ion current chromatograms (TIC) and median peak heights. Identified metabolites were filtered to ensure a maximum relative standard deviation (RSD) of 50% in the technical replicates of the pooled samples for the metabolomics study, and maximum RSD of 30% for the lipidomics study. Blank extraction buffer was analysed to identify and remove contaminating chemical species and sample carryover.
