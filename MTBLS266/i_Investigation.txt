Study Title	"Individual variability in human blood metabolites identifies age-related differences (30 persons, plasma data)."
Study Description	"Metabolites present in human blood document individual physiological states influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and life-style factors. Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we performed non-targeted, quantitative metabolomics analysis in blood of 15 young (29±4 yr) and 15 elderly (81±7 yr) individuals. Coefficients of variation (CV=standard deviation/mean) were obtained for 126 blood metabolites of all 30 donors. Fifty-five RBC-enriched metabolites, for which metabolomics studies have been scarce, are highlighted here. We found fourteen blood compounds that show remarkable age-related increases or decreases; they include 1,5-anhydroglucitol, dimethyl-guanosine, acetyl-carnosine, carnosine, ophthalmic acid, UDP-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-arginine, N6-acetyl-lysine, pantothenate, citrulline, leucine, isoleucine, NAD+, NADP+. Six of them are RBC-enriched, suggesting that RBC metabolomics is highly valuable for human aging research. Age differences are partly explained by a decrease in anti-oxidant production or increasing inefficiency of urea metabolism among the elderly. Pearson’s coefficients demonstrated that some age-related compounds are correlated, suggesting that aging affects them concomitantly. While our CV values are mostly consistent with those previously published, we here report novel CVs of 51 blood compounds. Compounds having moderate to high CV values (0.4-2.5) are often modified. Compounds having low CV values such as ATP and glutathione may be related to various diseases as their concentrations are strictly controlled, and changes in them would compromise health. Thus human blood is a rich source of information about individual metabolic differences. </p> Data from three injections of the same sample and three samples prepared from the same donated blood are available under accession number MTBLS263. Blood samples drawn from four volunteers four times within 24 h are available under accession number MTBLS264. Whole blood metabolomic data from all 30 subjects are available under accession number MTBLS265. RBC data from all 30 subjects can be found under MTBLS267."

Study Protocol Description	"Blood samples for metabolomic analysis were taken from vein into a 5 ml heparin tube (Terumo). Immediately, 0.2 ml blood were quenched in 1.8 ml −40 °C 55% methanol. The rest of the blood sample was centrifuged at 120 x g for 15 min at room temperature to separate plasma and red blood cells. After centrifugation 0.2 ml of separated plasma and red blood cells fraction, respectively, were quenched in 1.8 ml −40 °C 55% methanol."	"A constant amount of two internal standards (10 nmol of HEPES, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, and PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) was added to each sample. After brief vortexing, samples were transferred to Amicon Ultra 10-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove proteins and cell debris. Following sample concentration by vacuum evaporation, each sample was resuspended in 40 μl of 50% acetonitrile and 1 μl (equivalent to 5 μl of initial sample) was used for each injection into the LC-MS system."	"LC-MS data were obtained using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), as described previously[1]. Briefly, metabolites were separated on a ZIC-pHILIC column (Merck SeQuant, Sweden; 150 x 2.1 mm, 5 µm particle size) using acetonitrile (A) and 10 mM ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 9.3 (B) as the mobile phase, with gradient elution from 80% A to 20% A in 30 min, at a flow rate of 100 µl/min. Sample injection volume was 1 µl per run.

Each sample was analyzed twice, once in negative and once in positive ionization mode."	"Peak areas of metabolites of interest, within the raw LC-MS data, were measured using the MZmine 2.10 software and normalized using the peak areas of HEPES and PIPES. The complete workflow and processing parameters are summarized in the publication."	"Metabolites were identified by comparing their m/z values and retention times with authentic pure standards. If no standard was available, metabolites were assigned by analysis of MS/MS spectra (MS/MS), as described in the publication. In cases where no standard compound or MS/MS spectrum was available, compounds were identified by generating chemical formulae using m/z values in MZmine 2.10 module and given MS status."
