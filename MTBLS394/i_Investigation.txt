Study Title	"Lipid Data Analyzer: Decision rule set development by lipid standards of known constituent fatty acyl and/or alkyl/1-alkenyl chains and their respective sn-positions (Control experiment 1)."
Study Description	"The basic fragment rules are based on published results. From the experimental data, the rules were adapted and extended by visual inspection of spectra. Detectable fragments, mandatory fragment derived intensity rules, and extracted decisive differences for many isobaric subclasses/adducts were all identified. In addition, intensity relationships characteristic for sn-position assignment were determined."

"For each lipid species, 1 mol/l stock solutions were prepared, gravimetrically or by dilution, in chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v). Working solutions at 5 µmol/l were stored at -20 °C. Prior to analysis, aliquots were thawed to room temperature and storage solvent was replaced by injection solvent."	"Orbitrap Velos Pro CID and HCD:</br>
Chromatographic separation of lipids was performed on a Waters BEH C8 column (100 x 1 mm, 1.7 µm) (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), thermostated to 50 °C in a Dionex Ultimate XRS UHPLC (ultra-high performance liquid chromatography) system. Mobile phase A for chromatographic separation was deionized water containing 10 mmol/l ammonium formate and 0.1 vol% of formic acid. Mobile phase B was acetonitrile/2-propanol 5:2 (v/v) with the same additives. Gradient elution started at 50 % mobile phase B, rising to 100% B over 40 min, 100% B was held for 10 min and the column was re-equilibrated with 50% B for 8 min before the next injection. Flow rate was 150 µl/min and injection volume was 2 µl.
</p>
SYNAPT G1 HDMS QTOF:</br>
Chromatographic separation was performed using a BEH C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 1.7 µm) thermostated to 50 °C in an AQUITY UPLC system (Waters, Manchester, UK). Mobile phases A and B were water/methanol 1:1 (v/v), and 2-propanol, respectively, both containing 8 µmol/l phosphoric acid, 10 mmol/l ammonium acetate and 0.1 vol% formic acid. Flow rate was 150 µl/min; the linear gradient starting at 45% B reached 100% B within 32 min, followed by 10 min at this level, and re-equilibration for 8 min.
</p>
4000 QTRAP:</br>
Chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent HPLC 1100 system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). A Kinetex C8 column (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used. Mobile phases were identical as used for Orbitrap Velos Pro.

</p>
For the metabolites assignment, a pipe "|" was used to discriminate between the individual MS runs, while comma "," was used to account for several identifications (e.g. several retention times) and ambiguous identifications (e.g. DG 20:0/18:0/-,20:0/-/18:0 corresponds to a diacylglyceride where 20:0 is identified to be on the sn-1 position, while 18:0 might be at sn-2 or sn-3).
