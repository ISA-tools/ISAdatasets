STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS425"
Study Title	"Metabolomics Identifies Metabolic Markers of Maturation in Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes"
Study Description	"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) hold immense clinical potential and recent studies have enabled generation of virtually pure hPSC-CMs with high efficiency in chemically defined and xeno-free conditions. Despite these advances, hPSC-CMs exhibit an immature phenotype and are arrhythmogenic in vivo, necessitating development of methods to mature these cells. hPSC-CMs undergo significant metabolic alterations during differentiation and maturation. A detailed analysis of the metabolic changes accompanying maturation of hPSC-CMs may prove useful in identifying new strategies to expedite the maturation process and also provide biomarkers for testing or validating hPSC-CM maturation. In this study we identified global metabolic changes which take place during long-term culture and maturation of hPSC-CMs derived from three different hPSC lines. We have identified several metabolic pathways, including phospholipid metabolism and pantothenate and Coenzyme A metabolism, which showed significant enrichment upon maturation in addition to fatty acid oxidation and metabolism. We also identified an increase in glycerophosphocholine and reduction in phosphocholine as potential metabolic biomarkers of maturation. These biomarkers were also affected in a similar manner during murine heart development in vivo. These results support that hPSC-CM maturation is associated with extensive metabolic rewiring and understanding the role of these metabolic changes in maturation process has the potential to develop novel approaches to monitor and expedite hPSC-CM maturation."

Study Protocol Description	"For in vitro human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs), sample collection was performed as described previously.[1][2] Briefly, the cells in 1 well from 12 well plate (~1-2 million) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and then the cells were quenched using 3 ml methanol. The cells were then detached using a cell scraper and pipetted into a 50 ml centrifuge tube.

PMID:27811964</br>"	"The quenched cells were suspended in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water in the ratio of 6:6:5.4 to achieve a final volume of 17.4 ml. After centrifugation for 15 min at 3600 rpm, the upper aqueous layer was used for further analysis and the organic phase was discarded. The aqueous phase from samples were dried at 30 °C using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator and stored at -80 °C until NMR analysis."	"Prior to NMR analysis, the samples were reconstituted in 0.6 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffered D2O (pH 7.0) solution containing 0.5 mM 3-trimethylsilyl-propionate-2, 2, 3, 3,-d4 (TMSP, d = 0.0 ppm) as an internal standard and 0.2% w/v sodium azide. The samples were centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 10 min and 550 µl of the supernatant was transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes (Norell Inc.)."	"1H NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III equipped with a 5 mm 13C/15N(1H) cryogenic probe operating at 500 MHz (11.74 T)."	"1D spectra were acquired using standard NOESYPR1D pulse sequence (RD-90°-t1-90°-tm-90°-acquire) with a relaxation delay of 1 s, a mixing time of 100 ms and a pre-scan delay of 30 µs. Each spectrum consisted of 128 transients or free induction decays (FIDs) collected into 48 K complex data points with a spectral width of 12 ppm and an acquisition time of 4 s. Prior to Fourier transformation, the FIDs were zero-filled to 128 k data points and multiplied by an exponential window function (Line broadening factor (LB) = 0.5 Hz). The chemical shifts were referenced to the TMSP peak (d = 0 ppm), using TopSpinTM software (version 3.1, Bruker)."	"Spectra were exported to an ACD/1D NMR Processor (Advanced Chemistry Development) for phasing, baseline correction, and solvent region removal (water: 4.7-5.1 ppm and DMSO: 2.72-2.75 ppm)."	"The peaks were annotated through the HMDB[1], Metabohunter[2] and targeted profiling[3] was accomplished using ChenomX NMR Suite Profiler (version 7.7, ChenomX Inc.). The concentrations were referenced to a TMSP concentration of 0.5 mM.
