STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS62"
Study Title	"A large-scale metabolomics study to harness chemical diversity and explore biochemical mechanisms in ryegrass (UPLC-MS HILIC POS assay)"
Study Description	"Perennial ryegrass (<i>Lolium perenne</i>) is integral to temperate pastoral agriculture, which contributes most of the milk and meat production worldwide. Chemical profiles and diversity of ryegrass offer several opportunities to harness specific traits and elucidate underlying biological mechanisms for forage improvement. We conducted a large-scale metabolomics study of perennial ryegrass comprising 715 genotypes, representing 118 populations from 21 countries. Liquid/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based targeted and non-targeted techniques were used to analyse fructan oligosaccharides, lipids, fatty acid methyl esters, polar and semi-polar compounds. Fructan diversity across all genotypes was evaluated, high- and low-sugar groups identified, and fructan accumulation mechanisms explored. Metabolites differentiating the two groups were characterised, modules and pathways they represent deduced, and finally, visualisation and interpretation provided in a biological context. We also demonstrate a workflow for large-scale metabolomics studies from raw data through to statistical and pathway analysis. <br><br> <b>UPLC-MS HILIC POS assay</b> is reported in the current study MTBLS62.<br> <b>UPLC-MS HILIC NEG assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS63>MTBLS63</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS C18 reverse phase POS assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS64>MTBLS64</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS C18 reverse phase NEG assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS65>MTBLS65</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS C1 reverse phase POS and GC-MS FAME assays</b> are reported in <a href=""https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS66"">MTBLS66</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS C1 reverse phase NEG assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS68>MTBLS68</a>.<br> <b>HPLC-MS Hypercarb reverse phase NEG assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS529>MTBLS529</a>.<br>"

Study Protocol Description	"Ryegrass seeds were obtained from the Margot Forde Germplasm Centre at AgResearch Limited, Grasslands Research Centre, Palmerston North, New Zealand. Seeds of 724 genotypes (denoted by a specific code e.g. PG0698) which included NZ cultivars (82), natural population/ecotypes (49), NZ elite breeding populations (336), overseas cultivars (181), enhanced germplasm (71) and unknown cultivars (5) were selected. 5 clonal replicates (n = 5; denoted as PG0698_1 for the first replicate) per genotype were cultivated and used for metabolomics studies."	"At 60 days after transplanting, leaves were harvested during late autumn (May 2012), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze-dried, ground to a coarse powder, transferred to glass vials   and stored at -80 °C until further use. 5 aliquots of 50 mg each (4 for analyses and 1 standby) of each sample were weighed into microcentrifuge tubes. A surrogate QC sample59 comprising random amounts of ground ryegrass leaf material, irrespective of the presence or absence of endophyte was used. Since this QC sample was not representative of the sample set, it was solely used for monitoring sample degradation and for tracking run-order effects within a batch, and not used for batch normalisations or ensuing data processing.
</br></br>
A single aliquot (50 mg) was used for analysing both polar and semi-polar compounds. 1 ml of extraction solvent comprising acetonitrile:water containing 0.1% formic acid (50:50, v/v), and 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein (1 µg/ml; CAS No. 76-54-0; MW = 401.2) and L-Tyrosine-3, 3-d2 (10 µg/ml; CAS No. 72963-72-0; MW = 183.20) as internal standards for semi-polar and polar compounds respectively, were added to the aliquot. A ceramic bead was added and samples were mixed in a bead-mill homogeniser (TissueLyser II; Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) for 3 min, after which they were centrifuged for 6 min (18188 x g). Approximately 500 µl of the aqueous extract was transferred to an autosampler vial and stored at -20 °C until analysis."	"UPLC-MS conditions for analysis of polar and semi-polar compounds using ZIC-pHILIC columns, were as described previously[1]. Briefly, the Thermo LC–MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) consisted of an Accela 1250 quaternary UHPLC pump, a PAL auto-sampler fitted with a 15,000 psi injection valve (CTC Analytics AG., Zwingen, Switzerland) and 20 μl injection loop, and an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer with electrospray ionisation. A Merck polymeric bead based ZIC-pHILIC column (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 μm) was used for the chromatographic separation. The samples were separated at 25 °C with a gradient elution program and a flow rate of 250 μl/min. The mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile-formic acid (99.9:0.1, v/v) (solvent A) and water–ammonium formate (16 mM, pH 6.3) (solvent B). The gradient elution programme was: held at 97% A (0–1 min), 97–70% A (1–12 min), 70–10% A (12–14.5 min), held at 10% A (14.5–17 min), returned to 97% A (17–18.5 min) and allowed to equilibrate for a further 5.5 min prior to the next injection. The samples were cooled in the auto-sampler at 4 °C and the injection volume of each sample was 2 μl. The first 1.5 min and the last 5 min of the chromatogram were diverted to waste.
</br></br>
For each stream of analysis, samples (3575) were systematically randomised across 36 batches, making sure that 2 clonal replicates of a genotype were not present in the same batch. A single batch comprised approximately 100 samples interspersed with a QC sample for every 10 samples (10-12 QC samples per batch). The sequence comprised blanks, QC and samples.

Samples were run in positive ionisation mode. Positive ion mode parameters were as follows: spray voltage, 3.5 kV; capillary temperature, 325 °C; capillary voltage, 90 V, tube lens 120 V. The nitrogen source gas desolvation settings were (arbitrary units): sheath gas, 40; auxiliary gas, 10; sweep gas, 5."	"Collected data were processed using the Xcalibur software package provided by the manufacturer."	"XCMS[1] and in-house R scripts with appropriate parameters for HILIC settings were used for: 1) peak detection using centwave; 2) grouping; 3) retention time alignment using obiwarp; 4) peak re-grouping; and 5) filling of missing peaks.
</br></br>
The resultant data matrices were cleaned and post-processed by using: 1) diffreport function of XCMS to generate extracted ion chromatograms of all identified peaks, and eliminating the ones that represented background noise, and; 2) CAMERA[2] to identify and eliminate isotopes (HILIC and C18), and 3) normalisation for batch-effects using comBat[3]. The final data matrices of metabolic features were used for local library matching and statistical analysis. Metabolic features, defined here as molecular entities or ion types with a unique mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time.
