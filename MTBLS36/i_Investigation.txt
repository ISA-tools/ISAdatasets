Study Title	"Metabolic differences in ripening of Solanum lycopersicum 'Ailsa Craig' and three monogenic mutants"
Study Description	"Application of mass spectrometry enables the detection of metabolic differences between groups of related organisms. Differences in the metabolic fingerprints of wild-type Solanum lycopersicum and three monogenic mutants, ripening inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Colourless non-ripening (Cnr), of tomato are captured with regard to ripening behaviour. A high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry system coupled to liquid chromatography produced a time series of the ripening behaviour at discrete intervals with a focus on changes post-anthesis. Internal standards and quality controls were used to ensure system stability. The raw data of the samples and reference compounds including study protocols have been deposited in the open metabolomics database MetaboLights via the metadata annotation tool Isatab to enable efficient re-use of the datasets, such as in metabolomics cross-study comparisons or data fusion exercises."

Study Protocol Description	"Wild-type Solanum lycopersicum (Ailsa Craig, AC++) and three ripening inhibited AC++ mutants were used in this study: non-ripening (NOR), ripening-inhibited (RIN), and colourless non-ripe (CNR) tomatoes. The plants were grown in 24 cm-diameter pots in M3 compost (Levington Horticulture, Ipswich, and Suffolk, UK) and watered daily under standard greenhouse conditions. Flowers were sampled in five to ten day intervals up to anthesis (10, 15, 20, 30, 40) and daily post-anthesis (47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54). Breaker fruit were defined as those showing the first signs of ripening-associated colour change from green to orange. Non-ripe mutants were taken at day 49 as post-anthesis equivalents to breaker WT fruits. All plant samples were taken at the same time each day, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C until required.
</p>
Internal standards for reference tomato aliquots comprised the following (final concentration): Citric acid-d4 (1000 µg/ml), L-Alanine-d4 (200 µg/ml), Glutamic acid-d5 (200 µg/ml), and L-Phenyl-alanine-d5 (100 µg/ml). Pooled in-house standard tomato reference was prepared from the shop bought Angelle variety: mashed up in bulk and aliquoted out."	"Tomato samples were subjected to an untargeted metabolite analysis by LC-MS/MS of polar extracts.  Approximately 30 mg of dried tomato tissue was extracted with HPLC analytical grade ethanol/water 20:80. The polar extracts were diluted 10:1 with water and injected underivatised. Samples were acquired in three batches on 17, 20, and 21 September 2010 in positive ion mode and on 23, 24, and 27 September 2010 in negative ion mode."	"All samples were run on a Waters Acquity® UPLC system (Waters Corporation, USA), HSS T3 150 x 2 mm, 1.7 µm particles, UPLC column at 30 °C oven temperature. The solvents used for the assay consisted of 0.2% Formic Acid (Solvent A) and 98/2/0.2 acetonitrile/water/formic acid (Solvent B). Gradient [time (min) / %B] starting at flow rate 0.25 ml/min: 2.5/0, 7.5/10 (flow rate to 0.4 ml/min), 10.0/100, 12.0/100, 18.0/0, 25.0/0. Aliquots of 2 µl were injected."	"The compounds were detected using a Thermo LTQ Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer operating in positive and negative Electrospray ionization (ESI) mode at a resolution of 30,000 with a scan range from 85-900 m/z and 95-900 m/z respectively. MS/MS spectra were obtained in a data dependent manner through higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD, normalized collision energy: 50.0) at a resolution of 7,500. The two most intense mass spectral peaks detected in each scan were fragmented to give MS2 spectra (100-900 m/z). Full scan data was acquired in FT (accurate mass) mode, MS/MS spectra were acquired in centroid mode. The LTQ Velos Orbitrap used the Xcalibur control software version 2.1.0 for data acquisition."	"Non-targeted LC-MS/MS vendor raw data files were converted to the open source format mzML using the program ProteoWizard[1]. Vendor-based peak picking was enabled for MS[2]. The resulting mzML files were further processed with MassCascade[3] submitted within KNIME[4], the open source Konstanz Information Miner environment. Features were extracted with ±5 p.p.m. mass accuracy and subsequently deconvoluted using a modified Bieman algorithm[5] after noise reduction[6][7]. The workflow including all settings is available at MyExperiment[8] under this article’s title. Obiwarp[9] was used for cross-sample alignment. The maximum percentage of missing values per group and feature was set to 10%. Gaps in the resulting sample by feature matrix were either backfilled or – if missing – imputed using a PCA-based approach[10]. Statistical analysis was carried out in the statistical programming environment R, version 3.0.2. Total signal intensity normalization and Pareto scaling were used for data pre-treatment.
