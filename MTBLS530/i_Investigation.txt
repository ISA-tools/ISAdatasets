STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS530"
Study Title	"Neuronal Hyperactivity due to Loss of Inhibitory Tone in APOE4 Mice Lacking Alzheimer’s Disease-like Pathology"
Study Description	"Metabolite profiling was performed on metabolites extracted from the entorhinal cortex and primary visual cortex of 14-15 month old APOE3/3, APOE3/4 and APOE4/4 mice. Metabolites were run on a TOF Mass Spectrometer using an ANP column. Initial analysis was done in an untargeted manner, and processing was done to determine the differentially expressed metabolites based on their mass and retention times. Further analysis was then performed to assign identities to the differentially expressed metabolites using a database of biologically-relevant metabolites whose standards had been run under identical conditions as the samples in the study."

Study Protocol Description	"Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation to maintain the brain environment, and individual brain regions were immediately removed and snap-frozen on dry ice. Tissues were stored at -80 °C for prior to extraction."	"Metabolite extraction was performed using a methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/methanol extraction protocol modified from previous reports 86,87. Briefly, individual EC or PVC tissues were homogenized in 400 µl of ice-cold methanol using a bead mill homogenizer (TissueLyser II, Qiagen) at 25 beats/s, 2x for 45 s each. Following homogenization, samples were incubated in 1200 µl of MTBE for 1 hr at room temperature to separate organic-soluble lipids from aqueous-soluble lipids and other small-molecules. Finally, 360 µl of ultrapure water was added (for a final ratio of 3:1:0.9 MTBE:methanol:water) to resolve the 2 liquid phases, and each samples were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min. The lower aqueous phase and the upper organic phase was collected from each sample and stored in separate tubes, and the remaining protein pellets were resuspended in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, with 2.5% SDS. A BCA protein assay was performed on each protein fraction, and both the aqueous phase and organic phase were normalized to their protein concentration equivalent with 50% and 100% methanol respectively. All samples were then stored at -80 °C prior to analysis."	"Metabolite profiling was performed using an Agilent Model 1200 liquid chromatography (LC) system coupled to an Agilent Model 6230 time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. Metabolite separation was accomplished using aqueous neutral phase (ANP) gradient chromatography on a Diamond Hydride column (Microsolv), with mobile phase buffer A consisting of 50% isopropanol and 0.025% acetic acid, and mobile phase buffer B consisting of 90% acetonitrile and 5 mM ammonium acetate."	"Metabolite profiling was performed using an Agilent Model 1200 liquid chromatography (LC) system coupled to an Agilent Model 6230 time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. Each aqueous phase sample was analyzed in both positive and negative ion detection mode for comprehensive coverage of metabolites with a mass of 50-1000 Da."	"Following MS analysis, the raw data was analyzed using Agilent Profinder (version B.06.00) and Mass Profiler Professional (version 12.0) software. Briefly, Profinder performs batch recursive feature extraction, which consists of a first-pass identification of features (ions) that possess a common elution profile (e.g. identical mass-to-charge [m/z] ratios and retention times), followed by a recursive analysis to re-mine each sample for the presence of features that were identified in at least one sample. Feature extraction was limited to the top 2000 metabolites per ion detection mode, with each metabolite possessing a minimum abundance of 600 ion counts. Each feature was also manually validated following extraction (with investigators blinded to genotype assignments during validation), and re-integration was performed when necessary. Differential expression analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney tests, with a Benjamini Hochberg correction applied to adjust for false-positive discovery rates (FDR) considering multiple group comparisons."	"In addition to this untargeted feature extraction, we also used ProFinder to perform a targeted feature extraction, matching features against a proprietary database of 626 biologically-relevant metabolites whose mass and retention times were previously determined using pure chemical standards. For this analysis, we allowed for a maximum mass deviation of 10 mDa and a retention time deviation of 1 min, and identified features were manually validated following extraction."
