Study Identifier	"MTBLS224"
Study Title	"Metabolic fingerprinting of different populations of Phyllanthus niruri L. from Punjab using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI–MS)"
Study Description	"There is growing interest of healthcare and food industry in ingredients of plant origin as they are potent sources of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and anticancer agents. In the present work different extracts of Phyllanthus niruri L. from various regions of Punjab were screened for their phenolic profiles and antioxidant properties. Crude extracts obtained by solid–liquid extraction with different solvents were tested for total anthocyanins, flavonoids, phenolic content, and free radical scavenging activity. Out of all the solvents used, methanol was regarded as best to be used for soxhlet extraction of plant metabolites, as it provided highest phenolic, flavonoid, antioxidant, and anthocyanin contents. Similarly, ESI–MS was employed to obtain mass profiles of phenolic and other metabolites present in various P. niruri populations. Out of 72 compounds detected, 51 are reported for the first time in P. niruri L. Similarly, different populations of P. niruri were discriminated through metabolic fingerprinting using ESI–MS."

Study Protocol Description	"The Phyllanthus niruri samples were collected from various regions of Punjab, India viz. Bathinda, Amritsar, Roopnagar and Patiala. The collected populations were washed thoroughly under running water to remove soil and other extraneous matter. The samples were then shade dried properly for atleast a month and dried samples were crushed using electric grinder to get fine powder."	"Aqueous extract:</br>
P. niruri powders (500 g) from various regions of punjab (Amritsar, Bathinda, Patiala and Roopnagar) were macerated using 1 l of millipore water in a sterile glass container, stirred intermittently and then left overnight under hygienic conditions. After maceration, it was filtered through Whatmann filter paper (110 mm) and the filtrate was separated and stored asceptically in an air tight container at -20 °C until further analysis.
</p>
Ethanolic and Methanolic Extract:</br>
For ethanolic extract of each region, soxhalation of the powder was achieved using ethanol as solvent. 500 g of powder was soxhalated using 1l of ethanol for 24 hr. Positive pressure (2-3 bar) was provided to evaporate solvent and to obtain ethanolic extract. Methanolic extract was prepared in the same way by using methanol as solvent.
</p>
Hydroalcoholic Extract:</br>
Air dried plant powder of P. niruri was minced and extracted with 50% ethanol and water in 1:3 ratio. The fraction was then macerated at room temperature (25 ± 3 °C) for 15 days. The solvent was evaporated and the extract was concentrated to desired level using vaccum evaporator and stored at -20 °C until furthur analysis."	"None reported."	"The crude extracts (aqueous, ethanolic, methanolic and hydroalcoholic) of Phyllanthus niruri from different districts were mixed with their corresponding solvents (1:9) and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernetant obtained was filtered through HEPA filters (0.47 micron membrane filter) and the filterates were further used for mass spectral analysis of phytochemicals present in P. niruri at NIPER (National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research), Mohali, India. Extracts of aqueous, ethanolic and methanolic reaction mixtures were analyzed using ESI-MS (Thermo, Model: LTQ-XL) under positive ionization mode, for the characterization of phenolic compounds present in Phyllanthus niruri between m/z ratio 100-800. Scan m/z range: 100-800. Scan polarity: positive ionization mode. Instrument: Thermoscientific LTQ-XL quadrupole ion trap. Mass analyzer: quadrupole ion trap."	"No information provided."	"Metabolite identification was done using various databases such as Phenol Explorer, Mass Data Bank, KEGG compounds and on the basis of literature data."
