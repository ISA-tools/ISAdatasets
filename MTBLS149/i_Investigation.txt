Study Title	"Metabolomic assessment of acute cholestatic injuries induced by thioacetamide and by bile duct ligation, and the protective effects of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction"
Study Description	"Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction, a traditional Chinese formula, has been reported to protect liver from various injuries. Two cholestasis models of rats induced by thioacetamide and by bile duct ligation were established and treated with Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-based urinary metabolic profiles were analyzed by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis and univariate analysis to excavate differential metabolites associated with the injuries of the two models and the treatment effects of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction. The two cholestatic models shared common metabolic features of excessive fatty acid oxidation, insufficient glutathione regeneration and disturbed gut flora, with specific characteristics of inhibited urea cycle and DNA damage in thioacetamide-intoxicated model, and perturbed Kreb's cycle and inhibited branched chain amino acid oxidation in bile duct ligation model. With good treatment effects, Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction could regain the balance of the disturbed metabolic status common in the two cholestasis injuries, e.g., unbalanced redox system and disturbed gut flora; and perturbed urea cycle in thioacetamide-intoxicated model and energy crisis (disturbed Kreb's cycle and oxidation of branched chain amino acid) in bile duct ligation model, respectively."

Study Protocol Description	"72 male Sprague-Dawley rats (with an average age of 8 weeks and weight of 220–240 g), were bought from Laboratory Animal Research Center, Nanjing University (Nanjing, China).
</p>
Animals were housed individually in metabolic cages to collect urine samples at the following time periods: 0-8 h (T1), 8-24 h (T2), 24-32 h (T3), 32-48 h (T4), 48-72 h (T5), 72-96 h (T6), 96-120 h (T7) and 120-144 h (T8) after treatment. All urine samples were collected over dry ice with the addition of sodium azide (0.1% w/v urine solution) to the collection vessel to minimize bacterial contamination. At the end of the collection, urine was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C."	"The deep-frozen urine samples were thawed at 4 °C overnight, and then were vortexed to dissolve any precipitates."	"An aliquot of 400 μl urine was mixed with 200 μl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (0.2 M Na2HPO4 and 0.2 M NaH2PO4, pH 7.0), allowed to equilibrate for 10 min prior to centrifugation (12,000 x g for 10 min, at 4 °C). The supernatant was mixed with 50 μl TSP solution (dissolved in D2O, 1 mg/ml) and used for analysis."	"All NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AV 500 MHz spectrometer, with a nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy presaturation (NOESYPR) pulse sequence (relaxation delay -90°-t1-90°-tm-90°-acquire-FID). "	"Typically, 64 FIDs were collected into 32k data points, using a spectral width of 10 kHz, an acquisition time per scan of 2.54 s, recycle delay of 2 s and a mixing time of 100 ms. With TopSpin software (version 3.0, Bruker Biospin, Germany), all the spectra were automatically phased and baseline corrected, and calibrated to TSP at 0.00 ppm."	"With the removal of signals of water and urea (4.2-5.9 ppm), the NMR spectra were aligned in R, a freely available, open-source software (R Development Core Team, http://cran.r-project.org/). Regions between 0.5-9.8 ppm were binned, probabilistic quotient normalized, mean-centered and pareto scaled in R prior to multivariate statistical analysis"	"Aided by Statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY), metabolites were identiﬁed by comparison with the standard references in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) (www.hmdb.ca) under the help of Chenomx NMR Suite, version 4.0 (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Canada). These assignments were finally confirmed by 2D NMR techniques, e.g. 1H-1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and 1H-13C heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC)."
