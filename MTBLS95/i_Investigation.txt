Study Title	"Decreased abundance of type III secretion systeminducing signals in Arabidopsis mkp1 enhances resistance against Pseudomonas syringae"
Study Description	"Genes encoding the virulence-promoting type III secretion system (T3SS) in phytopathogenic bacteria are induced at the start of infection, indicating that recognition of signals from the host plant initiates this response. However, the precise nature of these signals and whether their concentrations can be altered to affect the biological outcome of host-pathogen interactions remain speculative. Here we use a metabolomic comparison of resistant and susceptible genotypes to identify plant-derived metabolites that induce T3SS genes in Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 and report that mapk phosphatase 1 (mkp1), an Arabidopsis mutant that is more resistant to bacterial infection, produces decreased levels of these bioactive compounds. Consistent with these observations, T3SS effector expression and delivery by DC3000 was impaired when infecting the mkp1 mutant. The addition of bioactive metabolites fully restored T3SS effector delivery and suppressed the enhanced resistance in the mkp1 mutant. Pretreatment of plants with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to induce PAMP triggered immunity (PTI) also restricts T3SS effector delivery and enhances resistance by unknown mechanisms, and the addition of the bioactive metabolites similarly suppressed both aspects of PTI. Together, these results demonstrate that DC3000 perceives multiple signals derived from plants to initiate its T3SS and that the level of these host-derived signals impacts bacterial pathogenesis."

Study Protocol Description	"Two-week-old Arabidopsis (ecotype Wassilewskija, Ws) plants grown on Murashige and Skoog agar medium, as well as the loss-of-function mutant mkp1(Ws) and mkp1 mpk6(Ws) plants described previously [1], were placed in water. After incubation for 4 h to overnight, the water (the "exudate") was removed, filtered (0.22 µM), and stored at -20 °C.

Plant J 67(2):258–268. doi:10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04588.x. PMID:21447069</br>"	"For the derivatization, 20 µl of methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg/ml) were added to each sample, followed by incubation at 37 °C with shaking for 90 min to protect carbonyl groups. Next, 80 µl of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) were added to each vial, followed by incubation at 37 °C with shaking for 30 min to derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups. The samples were then allowed to cool to room temperature."	"The samples were analyzed by an Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Separations were performed on a HP-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies). The injection mode was splitless, and the injection port temperature was held at 250 °C. The column oven was initially maintained at 60 °C for 1 min and then ramped to 325 °C by 10 °C/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325 °C."	"An Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used, and the samples were blocked and analyzed in random order for each experiment. Data were collected over the mass range 50-550 m/z. A mixture of FAMEs (C8-C28) was analyzed once per day together with the samples for retention index alignment purposes during subsequent data analysis."	"GC-MS raw data files from each Experiment were processed using the MetaboliteDetector software, version 2.0.6 beta. Briefly, Agilent.D files were converted to netCDF format using Agilent Chemstation, followed by conversion to binary files using Metabolite Detector. Retention indices of detected metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of the FAMEs mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all analyses after deconvolution."	"Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to an augmented version of FiehnLib (i.e., the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites), using a Metabolite Detector match probability threshold of 0.6 (combined retention index and spectral probability). All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to eliminate false identifications. The NIST 08 GC-MS library was also used to cross validate the spectral matching scores obtained using the Agilent library and to provide identifications of unmatched metabolites. Fragment ions due to trimethylsilylation (i.e. m/z 73 and 147) were excluded from the determination of metabolite abundance. A matrix of identified metabolites, unidentified metabolite features (characterized by mass spectra and retention indices and assigned as 'unknown'), and their abundances was created for each Experiment for statistical analysis. Features resulting from GC column bleeding were removed from the data matrices prior to further data processing and analysis."
