Study Title	"Fission yeast ceramide ts mutants cwh43 exhibit defects in G0 quiescence, nutrient metabolism, and lipid homeostasis (Lipidome assay)"
Study Description	"Cellular nutrient states control whether cells proliferate, or whether they enter or exit quiescence. Here, we report characterizations of fission yeast temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of the evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein, Cwh43, and explore its relevance to utilization of glucose, nitrogen-source, and lipids. GFP-tagged Cwh43 localizes at ER associated with the nuclear envelope and the plasma membrane, as in budding yeast. We found that cwh43 mutants failed to divide in low glucose and lost viability during quiescence under nitrogen starvation. In cwh43 mutant, comprehensive metabolome analysis demonstrated dramatic changes in marker metabolites that altered under low glucose and/or nitrogen starvation, although cwh43 apparently consumed glucose in the culture media. Furthermore, we found that cwh43 mutant had elevated levels of triacylglycerols (TGs) and coenzyme A, and that it accumulated lipid droplets. Notably, TG biosynthesis was required to maintain cell division in cwh43 mutant. Thus, Cwh43 affects utilization of glucose and nitrogen-sources, as well as storage lipid metabolism. These results may fit to a notion developed in budding yeast that Cwh43 conjugates ceramide to GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchored proteins and maintains integrity of membrane organization. </br></br> Lipidome assay data is reported in the current study MTBLS578. </br> Metabolome assay data associated to this study is reported in MTBLS577. </br><br/> Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS577' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS577</span></a>"

Study Protocol Description	"Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains used in this study were derived from haploid wild-type strains 972 (h-) and 975 (h+). A collection of temperature-sensitive (ts) strains made by random mutagenesis was used as has been previously described[1].
</p>
Cultured cells (40 ml per sample, 5 x 10^6 cell/ml) were harvested by vacuum filtration using an Omnipore membrane filter (Millipore, 47 mm diameter and 1 μm pore size). The filter was immediately dropped into a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 25 ml methanol previously chilled to −40 °C. Tubes were kept at −40 °C for approximately 3 min, mixed with a vortexer for 10 s and the filter was removed using forceps. Cells were collected by 3000 rpm centrifugation at −20 °C for 3 min and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was re-suspended in 1 ml 50% methanol (−40 °C) and 10 μl of 1 mM PIPES + HEPES mixture was added as an internal standard.

PMID:15369671</br>"	"For lipid extraction of S. pombe cells, non-polar lipids were first extracted with 750 μl tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME) and 250 μl of 40 mM NaCl. Second, polar lipids were extracted with 500 μl TBME/water saturated-1-butanol (3:2) and mixed with non-polar lipid extracts. Samples were then concentrated by vacuum evaporation and re-suspended in 100 μl of the mixed solvent (water saturated-1-butanol/2-Propanol/H2O, 1:1:1). 1 μl of sample was used for each LC-MS injection."	"LC-MS data were acquired using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). LC separation was performed on a Hypersil Gold C18 column (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 3 μm particle
size, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). 60% acetonitrile, 40% water, 10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid (A) and 90% isopropanol, 10% acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid (B) were used as the mobile phase, with gradient elution from 70% (A) to 0% (A) in 20 min followed by isocratic elution for 10 min, at a flow rate of 100 μl/min."	"LC-MS data were acquired using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan mode with a scan range of 200-1,200 m/z. Each sample was analyzed twice, once in negative and once in positive ionization mode."	"Raw LC-MS data were analyzed using MZmine 2 (version 2.21) software (http://mzmine.sourceforge.net). Peak areas were normalized by a weighted contribution of the internal standards (PIPES and HEPES) using MZmine 2. After performing peak detection, isotopic peaks were removed and peak lists of individual samples were aligned using their corresponding m/z and retention time values."	"Peak identification by mass search was performed using Lipidomics Gateway (http://www.lipidmaps.org/) and verified using accurate mass, MS/MS fragmentation patterns, and retention times (see Table S5 in the paper associated with this study). We defined the 'relative peak area' ratio as: relative peak area (ppm) = raw peak area/total raw peak area x 10^6."
