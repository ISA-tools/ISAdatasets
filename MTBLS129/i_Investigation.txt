Study Title	"Coordinate Regulation of Metabolite Glycosylation and Stress Hormone Biosynthesis by TT8 in Arabidopsis."
Study Description	"Secondary metabolites play a key role in coordinating ecology and defense strategies of plants. Diversity of these metabolites arise by conjugation of core structures with diverse chemical moieties, such as sugars in glycosylation. Active pools of phytohormones, including those involved in plant stress response are regulated by glycosylation. While, much is known about glycosylation enzymes, we know little about their regulation or coordination with other biological processes. We characterized the flavonoid pathway transcription factor, TRANSPARENT TESTA 8 (TT8) in Arabidopsis thaliana, using an integrative 'omics strategy to provide a systems level understanding of the cellular machinery used to generate metabolite diversity by glycosylation. Metabolomics analysis of loss-of-function and inducible overexpression lines of TT8 showed that it coordinates glycosylation of not only flavonoids, but also nucleotides, thus, implicating TT8 in regulating pools of activated sugars. Transcriptome and promoter network analyses revealed that TT8 regulome included sugar transporters, sugar binding and sequestration proteins, and carbohydrate active enzymes. Interestingly, TT8 also affects brassinosteroid and jasmonic acid biosynthesis by directly binding to the promoters of key genes of these two pathways. This combined effect on metabolites glycosylation and stress hormones by TT8 overexpression lead to significant increase in tolerance towards multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. Conversely, loss of TT8 leads to increased sensitivity to these stresses. Thus, TT8 is an integrator of secondary metabolism and stress response."

Study Protocol Description	"Arabidopsis thaliana plants of ecotype Wassilewskija (Ws-2) and tt8-3 (deb122) were obtained from Versailles (INRA, France). Seedlings were harvested after 6 days for metabolites extraction."	"Untargeted metabolic profiling was performed as described previously [1], with modifications (described in Supplemental Information) using two experimental platforms Agilent quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF 6540), and LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Metabolite extracts for four biological replicates of each line, with each replicate injected thrice as technical replicates were used in Q-TOF, while Orbitrap had three biological replicates of each line, with three technical replicates. Plant samples were snap frozen by liquid N2 and homogenized using mortar and pestle. 100 mg of homogenized samples were transferred to a 1.5 ml eppendrof tube and 0.5 ml of ice cold 80% methanol was added immediately, centrifuged twice at 4 °C, 13,500 rpm for 20 min and supernatant thus collected were used for mass spectrometry analysis.

In RJ Rose, ed, Legume Genomics, Humana Press. 2013;1069:279–312"	"In the first platform, Agilent 1290 UHPLC system was used in-line with Agilent Q-TOF 6540. 6 µl of each metabolite extract sample was chromatographed on a Zorbax Eclipse Plus-C18 column (100 mm length, 2.1 mm diameter, 1.8 µm particle size) with column temperature fixed at 50 °C. Flow rate was maintained at 0.3 ml/min in an 18 min run with a gradient mobile phase: A) 0.1% FA in water; B) 0.1% FA in ACN (t = 0 to 0.5 min, B = 10%; t = 0.5 to 12 min, B = 100%; t = 12 to 15 min, B = 100%; t = 15 to 15.1 min, B = 10%; t = 15.1 to 18 min, B = 10%). The eluent was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer by electrospray, during the whole period of injection samples were maintained at 4 °C. 
</p>
In second platform, we used Acquity UHPLC system (Waters) in-line with LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mm length, 2.1 mm diameter, 1.7 µm particle size) was used with column temperature fixed at 50 °C, with injection volume 10 µl sample vials were maintained at 7 °C. Solvents used were the same as in first approach with solvent flow rate of 0.4 ml/min and a linear gradient of 13 min. The following gradient was used: 5% B for 0.5 min, 5 to 100% B in 9 min, holding at 100% B for 2 min and re-equilibration at 5% B for 2 min."	"In the first platform, untargeted mass profiling was performed with Agilent Q-TOF 6540 using ESI probe in positive mode of ionization. Parameters for MS were: drying gas temperature 350 ºC with 10 l/min (nitrogen) flow rate, sheath gas temperature 400 ºC with 12 l/min (nitrogen) flow rate, capillary voltage 4000 V, data acquisition in centroid mode, resolution 30,000, acquisition rate 4 spectra/s, mass range 50 to 1200 m/z. The system was controlled by Mass-Hunter Data Acquisition Software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
</p>
In the second platform, untargeted mass profiling was performed with LTQ-Orbitrap Velos equipped with a heated electrospray probe (H-ESI II) in positive mode of ionization. The system was controlled by Xcalibur 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). ESI and MS parameters used for Orbitrap were as follows: spray voltage 5.0 kV, sheath gas and auxiliary nitrogen pressures 50 and 10 arbitrary units, respectively, capillary and heater temperatures 300 °C and 350 °C, respectively, tube lens voltages 110 V. The resolution was set at 60,000 for full MS scan (50 to 1200 m/z) with acquisition rate of 3 scan/second. Data were acquired in profile mode with external calibration."	"Raw data files from both Q-TOF (.d files) and Orbitrap (.RAW files) were converted into mzXML format using msconvert of the ProteoWizard suite [1]. Using parameters defined for Q-TOF (method = 'centWave', ppm = 30, peakwidth = c(10,60), prefilter = c(0,0); peak grouping: bw = 5, minfrac = 0.3, mzwid = 0.025; retention time correction algorithm: 'obiwarp') and  Orbitrap (method = 'centWave', ppm = 2.5, peakwidth = c(10,60), prefilter = c(3,5000); peak grouping: bw = 5, minfrac = 0.3, mzwid = 0.015; retention time correction algorithm: 'obiwarp') a total of 8734 (QTOF), 5969 (Orbitap) features were extracted using XCMS package [2][3](version 1.38) in R (R Core Team, 2014).

Metabolite profiles were analyzed using XCMS and Agilent's Mass Hunter Software. Log-transformed and quantile normalized data were then subjected to Mann-Whitney U test with multiple testing correction using Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate.

Principal Coordinates Analysis: (PCoA with Bray-Curtis distance measure) on three bio-replicates, each with three technical replicates for each genotype revealed over 23% (Orbitrap) and 47% (Q-TOF) separation between the two lines. Mann-Whitney test with p values adjusted (P < 0.05) using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rates was performed on the two groups yielding 1,259 and 611 differential features with P < 0.05 and fold change >2 on the two respective mass spectrometry platforms.
