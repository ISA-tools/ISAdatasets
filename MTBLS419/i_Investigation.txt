Study Title	"Evidence of a DHA signature in the lipidome and metabolome of human hepatocytes"
Study Description	"Cell supplementation with bioactive molecules often causes a perturbation in the whole intracellular environment. Omics techniques can be applied for the assessment of this perturbation. In this study, the overall effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on cultured human hepatocyte lipidome and metabolome has been investigated using NMR in combination with traditional techniques. The effect of two additional bioactives sharing with DHA the lipid lowering effect - propionic acid (PRO) and protocatechuic acid (PCA) - has been also evaluated, also considering possible synergism. NMR analysis of the cell lipid extracts showed that DHA supplementation, alone or in combination with PCA or PRO, strongly altered the cell lipid profile. The perfect discrimination between cells receiving DHA (alone or in combination) and the other cells reinforced the idea of a global rearrangement of the lipid environment induced by DHA. Notably, GC and fluorimetric analyses totally confirmed the strong discrimination obtained by NMR. The DHA signature was evidenced not only in the cell lipidome, but also in the metabolome. Results herein reported indicate that NMR, combined with other techniques, represents a fundamental approach while studying the effect of the supplementation of bioactives, particularly in the case of molecules having a broad spectrum of mechanisms of action."

Study Protocol Description	"HepG2 human hepatoma cells were kept at 37 °C, 95% air, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Once a week, cells were split 1:20 into a new 75 cm2 flask, and medium was refreshed. Cells were seeded at a density of 0.6 × 10^6 cells (for fatty acid and lipid quantification) or at 1.0 × 10^6 cells (for NMR experiments). After 24 h, at 75%–80% confluence, cells were divided randomly into six groups: (i) not supplemented (NS); (ii) supplemented with 70 µM PRO; (iii) supplemented with 20 µM PCA; (iv) supplemented with 50 µM DHA; (v) supplemented with 50 µM DHA + 70 µM PRO; (vi) supplemented with 50 µM DHA + 20 µM PCA.</br>
</p>
DHA was dissolved in 100% ethanol, and complexed to bovine serum albumin (BSA); fatty acid–BSA complexes were prepared fresh each time at a final BSA concentration of 0.5% in serum-free DMEM. PCA was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) acidified with HCl (at pH 2), while PRO was dissolved in water. The final concentration of ethanol and DMSO was kept below 0.1% in serum-free DMEM. Control cells received corresponding amounts of BSA, ethanol and DMSO. DHA, PRO and PCA concentrations used in the study were evidenced to be non-cytotoxic in preliminary experiments.
"	"Cells were scraped off; the cell pellet was washed with ice-cold M9 buffer to remove traces of growth medium, and dissolved with 400 µl ice-cold DPBS buffer. Cells were lysed by sonication for 150 s by repeating the pulse 2 s on and 3 s off, then extracted using 800 µl of methanol-chloroform 1:1 (v/v) pre-cold at −80 °C. After mixing, vortex cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 14,000× g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting two phases were divided carefully, and the extraction procedure was repeated twice for each sample.</br>
"	"To prepare the water-soluble extracts, for each sample, the whole volume was evaporated, and the dried water-soluble cell extract was dissolved in 750 µl of phosphate sodium buffer (70 mM Na2HPO4; 20% (v/v) 2H2O; 0.025% (v/v) NaN3; 0.8% (w/v) sodium trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4]propionate (TMSP) pH 7.4). A total of 600 µl of the extract were then transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes (Bruker BioSpin srl; Rheinstetten, Germany) for the analysis.</br>
To prepare the lipid extract, for each sample, the whole volume was evaporated and the dried lipid cell extract was dissolved in 750 µl of CDCl3, and 600 µl were transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes (Bruker BioSpin srl; Rheinstetten, Germany) for the analysis."	"1H-NMR spectra for all samples were acquired using a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin srl; Rheinstetten, Germany) operating at 600.13 MHz proton Larmor frequency and equipped with a 5 mm PATXI 1H-13C-15N and 2H-decoupling probe including a z axis gradient coil, an automatic tuning-matching (ATM) and an automatic and refrigerated sample changer (SampleJet, Bruker BioSpin srl; Rheinstetten, Germany). A BTO 2000 thermocouple served for temperature stabilization at the level of approximately 0.1 K at the sample. Before measurement, samples were kept for 5 min inside the NMR probe head, for temperature equilibration at 300 K."	"For each sample, a monodimensional 1H NMR spectra was acquired with water peak suppression and a standard NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) pulse sequence using 32 scans; 98,304 data points; a spectral width of 18,028 Hz; an acquisition time of 2.7 s; a relaxation delay of 4 s; and a mixing time of 0.1 s."	"Free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential function equivalent to a 1.0 Hz line-broadening factor before applying Fourier transform. Transformed spectra were automatically corrected for phase and baseline distortions and calibrated (anomeric glucose peak at 5.24 ppm) using TopSpin (Version 3.8.4, Bruker). Each 1-D spectrum in the range between 0.02 and 10.00 ppm was segmented into 0.02 ppm chemical shift bins, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using AMIX software(Bruker BioSpin). Regions between 6.0 and 4.5 ppm containing residual water were removed."	"Signal identification was performed using a library of NMR spectra of pure organic compounds, public databases (such as HMBD, Human Metabolic Database, and SDBS, Spectra Database for Organic Compounds) storing reference NMR spectra of metabolites, spiking NMR experiments and literature data [1][2].</br>
