STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS378"
Study Title	"FDR-controlled metabolite annotation for high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry imaging MS (LC-MS assay)"
Study Description	"High-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry promises to localize hundreds of metabolites directly from tissues, cell cultures, and agar plates with cellular resolution, but is hampered by the lack of bioinformatics for automated metabolite identification. We developed the first bioinformatics framework for False Discovery Rate (FDR)-controlled metabolite annotation for high-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry (https://github.com/alexandrovteam/pySM) introducing a Metabolite-Signal Match (MSM) score and a target-decoy FDR-estimate for spatial metabolomics. LC-MS(/MS) datasets acquired from wild type adult mouse brain were used for the development of spatial metabolomics annotation bioinformatics. This study together with MTBLS317 and MTBLS378 provide the accompanying data for FDR-controlled metabolite annotation for high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry."

Study Protocol Description	"1 female adult wild-type C57 mouse age 10 weeks was obtained from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory animal resource (EMBL-LAR, Heidelberg, Germany). The animal was reared under ad-lib conditions within the specific pathogen free facility. Care and handling of the animal complied with EU directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. The whole brain was excised from each animal immediately post-mortem and rapidly cryo-frozen in CO2 cooled isopentane. Tissue was stored at -80 °C until use."	"20 mg of brain tissue was extracted using Bligh and Dyer extraction method[1]. The dried extract was reconstituted with 100 µl of methanol and isopropanol (1:1) and 10 µl of this sample solution was injected LC-MS system for each run. Lipid standards were prepared in same solvent with concentration of 100 ng/ml each.
</p>
All lipid standards used for validation of annotations were purchased from Sigma Chemicals (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) and Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, LA, USA). The LC- MS grade buffers and other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical. All mass spectrometry grade solvents and MiliQ grade water was used throughout the analysis.

PMID:13671378</br>"	"The separation of lipids was carried out on Agilent 1260 liquid chromatography (LC) system with Ascentis® Express C18 column (100 x 2.1 mm; 2.7 µM) and detected with high resolution mass spectrometry (Q Exactive Plus MS, Thermo Scientific). LC was run with flow rate of 0.25 ml/min with solvent A consisted of acetonitrile-water (6:4) and solvent B of isopropyl alcohol-acetonitrile (9:1), which were buffered with either 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid (buffer 1) or 10 mM ammonium acetate (buffer 2)."	"3 LC-MS/MS methods were used;</br>
Positive: ESI positive mode using buffer 1</br>
Negative 1: ESI negative mode method using buffer 1</br>
Negative 2: ESI negative mode method used buffer 2</br>
</p>
MS parameters (Tune, Thermo Scientific) were set as: spray voltage of 4 kV, sheath gas 30 and auxiliary gas 10 units, S-Lens 65 eV, capillary temperature 280 °C and vaporisation temperature of auxiliary gas was 280 °C. Data were acquired in full scan mode in mass range of 150-900 m/z (resolving power R=70000) and data dependent tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) were obtained for all precursors from an inclusion list (resolving power R=35000). Tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) were acquired using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with normalized collision energies of 10, 20 and 30 units at the mass. The inclusion list was composed of all annotations provided from imaging MS analysis and detected in all 3 serial sections (s1, s2, s3 at the Bregma 1.42) for either of 2 animals. We considered adducts relevant for LC-MS (+H, +NH4, +Na for the Positive method; -H, -H+HCOOH for the Negative methods)."	"Centroiding (vendor provided)"	"LC-MS/MS validation of lipid annotations was performed differently for annotations when lipid standards are available and for other annotations. When lipid standards were available, LC-MS/MS information in particular the LC retention time (RT), MS and MS/MS (MS2) was used to compare the data from a standard with the data from a sample (both acquired using exactly the same LC-MS method and precursor selection range).
</p>
First, extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) were evaluated for all possible adducts to confirm the presence of the ion of the sum formula obtained from imaging data. As for the tolerance value for XICs: for data with standards we used the 5 ppm; for data with no standards we selected the best fitting tolerance value from 2, 3, and 5 ppm. We considered possible adducts for each metabolite (+H, +Na, +NH4 for the ‘Positive’ method; -H, +FA-H for the ‘Negative’ methods, FA stands for the formic acid) and selected the best matching adduct as follows. The precursor delta_m/z was calculated for the sample both in MS1 and MS/MS data. The matching MS/MS spectrum was searched within the elution profile and manually interpreted for fragments corresponding to head-group and fatty acid side chains. Only precursor and fragments with accuracy <6 ppm were considered for structural interpretation to identify possible lipid species. The lipid class was confirmed by the presence of head-group fragment or its neutral loss (e.g. MS/MS fragment with m/z 184.0735 corresponds to the phosphocholine head-group). Since lipids from the classes of phosphatidylcholines (PC) and sphingomyelins (SM) have the same head-group (m/z 184.0735), given a sum formula, we searched in HMDB and SwissLipids to rule out a possibility of the sum formula to correspond to a lipid from another class other than annotated by our framework. Further to confirm the fatty acid side chains, the ‘Negative’ LC-MS methods were used (e.g. fatty acid fragments for phosphocholines were obtained after fragmentation of formate ion precursors using the ‘Negative’ LC-MS method). The collision energy was selected as best representing the precursor and the expected fragments. When standards were available, the RT, precursor m/z and MS/MS fragments corresponding to head-groups and fatty acid chains from the sample were matched with spectra from the corresponding standard. When standards were not available the fragments were manually interpreted.
</p>
Finally, structural annotation of the matching peaks in the MS/MS spectra was performed with the help of the HighChem MassFrontier software (Thermo Scientific). The MS, MS/MS and RT (for standards) data is presented in Supplementary Notes 1, 2 and summarized in Table S5 of the associated paper."
