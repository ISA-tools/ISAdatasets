Study Title	"eRah: A computational tool integrating spectral deconvolution and alignment with quantification and identification of metabolites in GCMS- based metabolomics"
Study Description	"Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been a long- standing approach used for identifying small molecules due to the highly reproducible ionization process of electron impact ionization (EI). However, the use of GC-EI MS in untargeted metabolomics produces large and complex datasets characterized by coeluting compounds and extensive fragmentation of molecular ions caused by the hard electron ionization. In order to identify and extract quantitative information of metabolites across multiple biological samples, integrated computational workflows for data processing are needed. Here we introduce eRah, a free computational tool written in the open language R composed of five core functions: (i) noise filtering and baseline removal of GC-MS chromatograms, (ii) an innovative compound deconvolution process using multivariate analysis techniques based on compound match by local covariance (CMLC) and orthogonal signal deconvolution (OSD), (iii) alignment of mass spectra across samples, (iv) missing compound recovery, and (v) identification of metabolites by spectral library matching using publicly available mass spectra. eRah outputs a table with compound names, matching scores and the integrated area of compounds for each sample. The automated capabilities of eRah are demonstrated by the analysis of GC-TOF MS data from plasma samples of adolescents with hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess and healthy controls. The quantitative results of eRah are compared to centWave, the peak-picking algorithm implemented in the widely used XCMS package, MetAlign and ChromaTOF software. Significantly dysregulated metabolites are further validated using pure standards and targeted analysis by GC-QqQ MS, LC-QqQ and NMR."

Study Protocol Description	"A dataset of a total of 25 plasma samples (11 young, non-obese adolescents with hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess and 14 age-, weight- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls) were analyzed by GC-EI-qTOF-MS (Agilent Technologies)[1].

Metabolomics reveals impaired maturation of HDL particles in adolescents with hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess. Sci Rep. 2015 Jun 23;5:11496. doi: 10.1038/srep11496."	"Plasma aliquots (25 µl) were thawed at 4 °C. Samples were briefly vortex-mixed and each aliquot was supplemented with 20 µl/min of 1 µg/µl succinic-d4 acid (internal standard). Proteins were then precipitated by the addition of 475 µl cold methanol/water (8:1 vol/vol) followed by 3 min ultrasonication and 10 sec vortex-mixing. Aliquots were subsequently maintained on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation for 10 min (19.000 g, 4 °C), 100 µl of supernatant were transferred to a GC autosampler vial and lyophilized. We incubated the lyophilized plasma residues with 50 µl methoxyamine in pyridine (40 µg/µl) for 30 min at 60 °C. To increase the volatility of the compounds, we silylated the samples using 30 µl N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 60 °C."	"Samples were anaylsed using an Aligent 7890A gas chromatographer coupled to a qTOF MS 7200 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Derivatized samples (1 μl each) were injected in the gas chromatograph system with a split inlet equipped with a J&W Scientific DB5-MS+DG stationary phase column (30 mm × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.1 μm film, Agilent Technologies). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in constant flow mode. The injector split ratio was adjusted to 1:5, and the oven temperature was programmed at 70 °C for 1 min and increased at 10 °C/min to 325 °C."	"The qTOF MS 7200 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was operated in the electron impact ionization mode at 70 eV. Mass spectral data were acquired in full scan mode from m/z 35 to 700 with an acquisition rate of 5 spectra per second."	"GC-MS data files were converted to .mzXML format using Proteowizard software."	"Aligned compounds were identified by comparing the mean spectrum to reference spectra in a MS library. The mean spectrum is determined by the mean of the compounds spectra found only in the deconvolution and alignment steps. The current eRah package integrates the free and downloadable version of the MassBank repository, which after removing duplicated compounds contains a set of 500 unique compounds with EI GC-TOF mass spectra. However, users may import other libraries such as the Golm Metabolome Database (GMD), Fiehn Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) or an internal database, as long as the library is available in an interpretable (i.e. readable) format. This refers to a non-binary non-coded format, which is consistent with public databases. By comparing the empirical spectra with a reference MS library, eRah generates a list of candidate metabolites along with a similarity match factor, determined using the cosine product."
