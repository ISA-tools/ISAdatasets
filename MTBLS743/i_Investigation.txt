Study Title	"Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis Reveals Increased Susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes in Young Asian Indian Males."
Study Description	"Studying the differential risk of normal healthy people for type 2 diabetes is essential in Asian Indian population. We believe that there exists a distinct metabolic transition state leading to a pre-diabetes state well in advance in those who are at risk of developing diabetes. We studied equal number of healthy females and males aged between 18 and 40 years, categorized into four groups; normal healthy controls(NC), first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes (FDR), overweight (OW), and pre-diabetic positive controls (PRD). Each study subjects consumed a mixed meal on the study day after an overnight fast. Blood samples were collected before the meal and then every 30 minutes after meal ingestion until 120 minutes. Blood samples were subjected to both clinical as well as mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics. We found markers of diabetes and inflammation such as C-peptide, adiponectin, Leptin, and GIP were significantly at different levels in participants who are having diabetes risks when compared to the control. Metabolite profiling was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography, ACQUITY UPLC System coupled to a Quadrupole Time of Flight mass spectrometer SYNAPT-G2, Waters. Progenesis QI was employed for peak picking and raw data deconvolution. The putative identification of those features was identified by HMDB, and MoNA database search. Our study showed that metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and bile acid metabolisms were altered in both genders."

The annotation is based on accurate mass values, isotope abundance, and MS/MS fragmentation patterns. Metabolites identification search was performed within a narrow mass error (10 ppm) by selecting databases such as Human metabolome database (HMDB2016) and MassBank of North America (MoNA). MS/MS fragmentation matching patterns were also evaluated and those annotations matched with fragmentation database were labelled as MS level 2 and remaining annotations are labelled as MS Level 3."

The questionnaire had information on socio-economic status, occupation, diet, lifestyle, health behavior, medical history and medication, as well as reproductive history of women. Only healthy people without any illness including diabetes or any nutritional disorders were selected for the study. People who are trying to lose weight, with allergy or those who are under medication where analysis could be affected were excluded from the study.

Progenesis QI (Non-linear dynamics, Waters) was employed for peak/feature picking and raw data deconvolution. Progenesis QI performs noise filtering, peak detection, isotope peak removal, alignment of retention time and mass, as well as optional peak/feature normalization. Progenesis produces a feature matrix that contains accurate mass (m/z), retention time (RT), and chromatographic peak area.  MetaX software was used for further processing of normalized data(Wen et al. 2017). The features detected in less than 50% in QC samples or less than 20% in experimental samples were removed. The missing values retained after the initial filtration were imputed with k-nearest neighbor method. A signal correction was performed with the QC-RLSC method to correct batch influence (Dunn et al. 2011). After normalization, features with a relative standard deviation of < 30% in the QC samples were used for further statistical analysis.

"	"The mass spectrometer was operated in resolution mode (MSE) with electrospray ionization (ESI). Data were acquired in both positive and negative modes for two chromatographic methods. The selected mass range was from 50 to 1200 m/z in full scan mode with a scan time of 0.25s and an inter-scan delay of 0.024s. Ion source and desolvation gas (nitrogen) temperatures were kept at 1120C and 3500C respectively. The sampling cone and desolvation gas flow rates were 60 L/h and 875 L/h respectively. Capillary voltage was set at 2.85 KV. Sampling cone voltage was set at 40V. The lock mass acquisition was made every 10 seconds by Leucine enkephalin (MW= 555.62) for accurate on-line mass calibration. Initial 10 QC samples run was used for the stabilization of the system (~4 hours). QC samples were analyzed after every 5th sample run. An analytical batch contains an equal number of samples from all study groups and run order was randomized within a batch. One analytical batch had 90 runs and data was acquired up to 35 hours without affecting the stability of the system"	"An ultra-performance liquid chromatography, ACQUITY UPLC System (Waters) coupled to a Quadrupole- Time of Flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer (SYNAPT-G2, Waters) was used for the analysis. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) technique was employed with a C18 (ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 C18 column, 100 A0, 1.8 μm, 2.1mm X 100mm, Waters) column. In the RPLC Method, mobile phase consists of aqueous (A) and organic (B) solvent components, where A is 0.1% formic acid in water and B is 0.1% formic acid in methanol. The gradient is 0 min, 0% B; 1 min, 0% B; 16 min, 100% B; 20 min, 100% B, and 22 min, 0% B. The curve parameter of 5 was used for the throughout the gradient except 1 was used for 20 to 22 minutes. The same gradient was used for positive and negative ion mode methods. For the wash cycle, weak wash solvent (100%) water and strong wash solvent (100%) methanol were used in RPLC method. Similarly, the hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) method was performed using a BEH (ACQUITY BEH HILIC column, 130 A0, 1.7 μm, 2.1mm X 150mm, Waters) column. For the HILIC, A is 95% Acetonitrile in 10mM ammonium acetate and B is 50% Acetonitrile in 10mM ammonium acetate. Both A and B contains 0.1% formic acid or 0.1% acetic acid in positive ion mode and negative ion mode respectively. The HILIC positive ion gradient was 0 min, 1% B; 5 min, 20 %B; 10 min, 50% B; 14 min, 95 %B; 16 min, 95 % B; 17 min, 1 %B; and 20 min, 1 %B. The curve parameter of 6 was used for the throughout the gradient. The HILIC negative ion gradient was 0 min, 1% B; 3 min, 20 %B; 6 min, 50% B; 9 min, 95 %B; 10 min, 95 % B; 11 min, 1 %B; and 15 min, 1 %B. The curve parameter of 6 was used for the throughout the gradient. For HILIC wash cycle, weak wash solvent (100%) acetonitrile and strong solvent (100%) were used. The injection volume was 5 µl with a flow rate of 0.4ml/min and the column temperature of〖 40〗^0 C."
