Study Identifier	"MTBLS160"
Study Title	"Natural variation of root exudates in Arabidopsis thaliana-linking metabolomic and genomic data"
Study Description	"The 19 parent lines of the Arabidopsis thaliana MAGIC collection show significant differences in their root exudate profiles. Changes in metabolism were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole time–of–flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) untargeted in positive and negative mode, and targeted for a set of known metabolites."

Study Protocol Description	"Seeds of the accession Bur-0, Col-0, Can-0, Ct-1, Edi-0, Hi-0, Kn-0, Ler-0, Mt-0, No-0, Oy-0, Po-0, Rsch-4, Sf-2, Tsu-0, Wil-2, Ws-0, Wu-0, and Zu-0 of Arabidopsis thaliana were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre and surface sterilized prior to plant cultivation. Then, all accessions were cultivated as previously described [1] in a hydroponic system with three independent biological experiments. Culture medium was used as a blank. This experimental setup resulted in 57 pooled root exudates and 228 root samples from individual plants.  For the analysis of root exudates, the content of four bottles (approximately 280 ml) was collected after the sixth week, pooled and stored at 4 °C in the dark until sample preparation.

PMID:25457500</br>"	"The pooled nutrient solution (280 ml) was spiked with 4 µg 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid and successively evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 °C to dryness using a 250 ml round-bottom flask and a vacuum rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was thoroughly reconstituted in 9 ml water/methanol, 95/5 (v/v), sonicated for 10 min at 20 °C, transferred into a 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 6000 x g for 10 min. An aliquot of the supernatant was subjected to solid phase extraction using a Bond Elut C18 cartridge (500 mg, 3 ml, Agilent, www.agilent.com). For that purpose, the cartridge was conditioned with 1 ml methanol, equilibrated with 1 ml water/formic acid, 98/2 (v/v) and loaded with 4 ml concentrated nutrient solution. The cartridge was washed with 1 ml water and retained compounds eluted using 1 ml methanol/formic acid, 98/2 (v/v). The eluate was evaporated to dryness at 40 °C using a vacuum centrifuge. The remaining residue was reconstituted in 120 µl water/methanol, 70/30 (v/v), sonicated for 5 min at 20 °C and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred into a glass vial and subjected to UPLC/ESI-QTOFMS analysis."	"Samples (2.6 µl, full loop injection) were separated at 40 °C on an Acquity UPLC platform (Waters, www.waters.com) equipped with a HSS T3 column (100 x 1.0 mm, particle size 1.8 µm, Waters) applying the following gradient at a flow rate of 150 µl/min: 0–1 min, isocratic 95% A (water/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)), 5% B (acetonitrile/formic acid, 99.9/0.1 (v/v)); 1–16 min, linear from 5 to 95% B; 16–18 min, isocratic 95% B; 18–20 min, isocratic 5% B."	"Eluting compounds were detected in positive and negative ionization mode from m/z 80 – 1000 using a MicroTOF–Q I hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with an Apollo II electrospray ion source (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA). Instrument parameters were defined as follows for the positive mode: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 1.6 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 6 l/min, 190 °C; capillary, –5000 V; end plate offset, -500 V; funnel 1 RF, 200 Vpp; funnel 2 RF, 200 Vpp; in-source CID energy, 0 V; hexapole RF, 100 Vpp; quadrupole ion energy, 5 eV, low mass 55; collision gas, argon; collision energy, 10 eV; collision RF 150 Vpp; transfer time, 70 µs; pre pulse storage, 5 µs; spectra rate, 3 Hz. For the negative ionization mode all parameters were maintained except for the capillary voltage (4000 V).
</p>
All mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode and recalibrated on the basis of lithium formiate cluster ions."	"Targeted:</br>
DataAnalysis 4.0 (Bruker Daltonics) was used for generation of extracted ion chromatograms, deconvolution of compound mass spectra and calculation of elemental compositions. For the relative quantification of compounds extracted ion chromatograms of quantifier ions were integrated applying QuantAnalysis 2.0 (Bruker Daltonics). 
</p>
Untargeted:</br>
Raw data files were converted to mzData using CompassXPort (Bruker Daltonics 4.0). Subsequently, the R package XCMS [1] was used for feature detection, alignment and filling of missing values. On this account, features were detected with the help of the centWave algorithm according to [2] (sntresh: 5, prefilter: (3,100), ppm: 20, peak width: (5,12), scanrange=c(1,3060) and aligned using the XCMS function group.density (minfrac: 0.75, bw: 2, mzwid: 0.05). Missing values were replaced with the help of the XCMS function fillPeaks.
