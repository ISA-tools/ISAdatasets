Study Title	"Absolute quantitative lipidomics reveals lipidome-wide alterations in aging brain (Mouse brain NEG UPLC-MS assay)"
Study Description	"INTRODUCTION: The absolute quantitation of lipids at the lipidome-wide scale is a challenge but plays an important role in the comprehensive study of lipid metabolism. </br> OBJECTIVES: We aim to develop a high-throughput quantitative lipidomics approach to enable the simultaneous identification and absolute quantification of hundreds of lipids in a single experiment. Then, we will systematically characterize lipidome-wide changes in the aging mouse brain and provide a link between aging and disordered lipid homeostasis. </br> METHODS: We created an in-house lipid spectral library, containing 76,361 lipids and 181,300 MS/MS spectra in total, to support accurate lipid identification. Then, we developed a response factor-based approach for the large-scale absolute quantifications of lipids. </br> RESULTS: Using the lipidomics approach, we absolutely quantified 1212 and 864 lipids in human cells and mouse brains, respectively. The quantification accuracy was validated using the traditional approach with a median relative error of 12.6%. We further characterized the lipidome-wide changes in aging mouse brains, and dramatic changes were observed in both glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Sphingolipids with longer acyl chains tend to accumulate in aging brains. Membrane-esterified fatty acids demonstrated diverse changes with aging, while most polyunsaturated fatty acids consistently decreased. </br> CONCLUSION: We developed a high-throughput quantitative lipidomics approach and systematically characterized the lipidome-wide changes in aging mouse brains. The results proved a link between aging and disordered lipid homeostasis. </br></br> Mouse brain NEG UPLC-MS assay data is reported in the current study MTBLS495. </br> Mouse brain POS UPLC-MS assay data associated to this study is reported in MTBLS562. </br><br/> Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS562' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS562</span></a>"

Study Protocol Description	"40 mice (C57BL/6J strain, SPF level) at 5 different ages (4, 12, 24, 32 to 52 weeks, n=8 in each group) were purchased from the HFK Bioscience Company (Beijing, China). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Heads were removed using a surgical scissor. The skulls were freed by flipping the skin and cut through the most anterior part. The parietal bones were tilted and broken off. The brains were freed from meninges and removed from the skull. Brains were washed to wipe off excess blood and immediately collected for storage at -80 °C."	"The frozen mouse brain tissue was weighed and homogenized in H2O (~200 μl H2O for ~10 mg tissue) using the homogenizer (Precellys 24, Bertin Technologies, France). Protein concentration in the homogenized solution was measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Catalog No. 23225, Thermo Fisher). Then, 50 μl of homogenized solution was taken and diluted to 2000 μl using water. Then, 4800 μl of the extraction solvent (MTBE:MeOH =5:1, v/v) containing 1 μl of SIL-IS (d7-PE (15:0/18:1), 100 ppm) was added. The solution was vortexed for 30 s, followed by 10 min of sonication, and centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The upper organic layer was collected. And an additional 2000 μl of MTBE was added to the bottom layer for re-extraction. The re-extraction was repeated twice. The pooled organic layer was evaporated using a vacuum concentrator. The dry extract was reconstituted using 100 μl of DCM:MeOH (1:1, v/v) prior to LC–MS/MS analysis."	"The LC–MS/MS analyses were performed using an UHPLC system (1290 series, Agilent Technologies) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TripleTOF 6600, AB Sciex). Chromatographic separations were performed on a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (particle size, 1.7 μm; 100 mm (length) x 2.1 mm (i.d.)) with a column temperature of 55 °C. The mobile phases A = 10 mM ammonium formate in H2O:ACN (6:4, v/v), and B = 10 mM ammonium formate in IPA:ACN (9:1, v/v), were used for both ESI positive and negative modes. The linear gradient elutes from 40 to 100% B (0–12min), 100% B (12–14min), 100 to 40% B (14–14.2 min), then equilibrate at 40% B until 18 min. And the flow rate was set as 0.3 ml/min."	"The mass spectrometry parameters were applied as follows: ion source gas 1 (GS1), 60 psi; ion source gas 2 (GS2), 60 psi; curtain gas (CUR), 30 psi; temperature, 600 °C; ionspray voltage floating (ISVF), 5000 V or -4500 V in positive or negative modes, respectively; declustering potential (DP), 100 V. Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) method was used for MS/MS acquisition. Each acquisition cycle consists of 1 rapid TOF MS survey scan (200 ms) followed by the consecutive acquisition of 11 product ion scans (50 ms each). For TOF MS survey scan, the mass range is from 200 to 2000 Da, and collision energy (CE) is set as 10 V. For product ion scan, the mass ranges are from 100 to 2000 Da, and collision energy (CE) is set as 45 ± 25 V. Dynamic background subtraction was applied. Dynamic exclusion is set as 4 s after 2 occurrences to ensure the non-repetitive acquisition of MS/MS spectra from the same ion.
</p>
To acquire the MS/MS spectra of lipid standards, lipid standards were first prepared at a concentration of 10 ppm in either MeOH/DCM (1:1, v/v) or MeOH/H2O(1:1, v/v). Each lipid standard solution was infused at a flow rate of 150 μl/min into the mass spectrometer without a LC column. Source parameters were set the same as above. In each acquisition, multiple collision energy (CE) levels were applied, including 9 fixed levels (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 V) and 5 ramp ones (55 ± 35, 50 ± 30, 45 ± 25, 40 ± 20, and 35 ± 15)."	"An in-house program, namely, LipidAnalyzer, is developed using R for the automatic data analysis. The raw data files (.wiff format) were converted to files in mzXML format using the 'msconvert' program from ProteoWizard (version 3.0.6526). Then the mzxML files were loaded into LipidAnalyzer for data processing. Peak detection was first operated on MS1 data. CentWave algorithm in XCMS was used for peak detection. The parameter 'peakwidth' was set as (5, 25) in unit of seconds, referring to the minimum and maximum peak widths for peak detection. The parameter 'snthresh' is set as 3 for sensitive peak detection. For multiple LC-MS data files, ordered bijective interpolated warping (OBI-Warp) algorithm in XCMS was used for peak alignment. CAMERA package is used for peak annotation. As a result, a peak table, including m/z, retention time (RT), and peak area information, was generated.
</p>
Next, we extracted the MS/MS spectra for each feature according to the m/z and RT. If 1 precursor ion is fragmented multiple times, the MS/MS spectrum closest to the peak apex was extracted and subjected to de-noising processing. Specifically, fragment ions in the MS/MS spectrum with intensity less than 30 counts or lower than 3% of the most abundant fragment ions (except precursor ion) were discarded. Besides, satellite ions (due to the ringing effect) close to main peak with mass difference less than 0.3 Da and relative intensity less than 20% were also removed. With the MS/MS spectrum, lipid identification was achieved through the spectral match using an in-house MS/MS spectral library. First, accurate mass match was performed to search all lipid species in the library with a mass tolerance of 25 ppm. Next, for each matched lipid, the corresponding experimental MS/MS spectrum was used to calculate the similarity with the MS2 spectrum in the library.
</p>
Finally, the absolute quantitation of lipids can be achieved using the peak area together with the SIL-IS and RF information."	"With the MS/MS spectrum, lipid identification was achieved through a spectral match using an in-house MS/MS spectral library.

Next, for each matched lipid, the corresponding experimental MS/MS spectrum was used to calculate the similarity with the MS2 spectrum in the library. A similarity score was calculated using the dot product function.
</p>
The similarity score ranges from 0 to 1, referring to no similarity and a perfect match, respectively. Lipid matches with scores larger than 0.8 were kept as true identifications."
