Study Identifier	"MTBLS720"
Study Title	"Skeletal muscle metabolomics and blood biochemistry analysis reveal metabolic changes associated with dietary amino acid supplementation in dairy calves"
Study Description	"The effects of different amino acid (AA) supplementations of milk protein-based milk replacers in pre-ruminant calves from 3 days to 7 weeks of age were studied. Animals were divided into 4 groups: Ctrl) Control group fed with milk protein-based milk replacer without supplementation; GP) supplementation with 0.1% glycine and 0.3% proline; FY) supplementation with 0.2% phenylalanine and 0.2% tyrosine; MKT) supplementation with 0.62% lysine, 0.22% methionine and 0.61% threonine. For statistical analysis, t-test was used to compare AA-supplemented animals to the Ctrl group. At week 7, body weight and average daily gain (ADG) were measured and blood samples and skeletal muscle biopsies were taken. Blood biochemistry analytes related to energy metabolism were determined and it was shown that MKT group had higher serum creatinine and higher plasma concentration of three supplemented AAs as well as arginine compared with the Ctrl group. GP group had similar glycine/proline plasma concentration compared with the other groups while in FY group only plasma phenylalanine concentration was higher compared with Control. Although the AA supplementations in the GP and FY groups did not affect average daily gain and metabolic health profile from serum, the metabolome analysis from skeletal muscle biopsy revealed several differences between the GP-FY groups and the Ctrl-MKT groups, suggesting a metabolic adaptation especially in GP and FY groups."

Study Protocol Description	"At 47.9 ± 0.46 days of age, a biopsy was obtained from semitendinosus muscle. Briefly, animals were injected with xylazine intravenously at the dose of 0.005 ml/kg BW, once the animals were sedated, the hind leg was shaved and disinfected with iodine povidone. Then, 2 ml of 0.02 g/ml lidocaine were subcutaneously injected as a local anaesthetic. A 3-cm cut in the skin and subcutaneous layer was done with a scalpel, and a 2-cm zone of the muscle was delimited with suture, and it was dissected with curve scissors. Finally, the muscular, subcutaneous and cutaneous layers were sutured. Muscle samples were immediately frozen into liquid nitrogen and subsequently kept at -80 °C until further analysis."	"Muscle tissues were transferred from -80 °C freezer to dry ice. All muscle tissues were ground into fine powder while mixed with liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle. The extraction of the aqueous metabolites was performed using a modified chloroform/methanol method previously described[1]. In brief: approximately 0.5 g of muscle tissue was mixed with 1.2 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2 v/v) in a glass tube and was vortexed for 1 min. Then an extra 0.4 ml of chloroform was added to compensate the evaporated chloroform and the tube was vortexed for an additional 1 min. Afterwards 0.4 ml of double distilled water was added and the tube vortexed again for 1 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1935 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. 1000 μl of the top (methanol/water) fraction was transferred into a 2 ml polypropylene tube and dried in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator.

The supernatants were transferred into NMR borosilicate tubes rated for 800 MHz (New Era, Vineland, NJ, USA)."	"1D 1H NOESY spectra were collected on an 800 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a room temperature HCN inverse Z-gradient probe (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA). "	"The pulse sequence used for 1D gradient NOESY with water pre-saturation was 'noesygppr1D' with the Bruker standard acquisition parameters for profiling (spectral width: 16393.443 Hz, recycling delay: 4 s, acquisition time: 1.9988480 s, mixing time 10 ms). 96 scans and 8 dummy scans were used for each spectrum resulting in a 10-min experiment. For select samples, additional homonuclear and heteronuclear spectra (1H J-resolved, 1H-1H COSY, and 1H-13C HSQC) spectra were also collected to assist with compound identification.ere also collected to assist with compound identification. "	"Spectra were processed with 1 Hz exponential appodization, no additional zero filling and polynomial baseline correction with the TopSpin 3.2 software (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA)."	"Selected spectra were assigned using database assisted spectral deconvolution with the Chenomx 8.1 NMR Suit (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) using its internal database as well as the human metabolite database data (http://www.hmdb.ca/). 2D TOCSY spectra and literature reports were also used to verify the identity of other metabolites. Then, compound quantification in reference to the TSP internal standard was performed within the same software. The limit used for compound quantification in Chenomx was set at 0.002 mM."
