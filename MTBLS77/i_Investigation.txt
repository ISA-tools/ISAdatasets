Study Title	"Impacts of the Callipyge mutation on ovine plasma metabolites"
Study Description	"The ovine Callipyge mutation causes postnatal muscle hypertrophy localized to the pelvic limbs and torso, as well as body leanness. The mechanism underpinning enhanced muscle mass is unclear, as is the systemic impact of the mutation. To investigate potential systemic effects of the mutation, 1H NMR spectra of plasma taken from lambs at 8 and 12 weeks of age were measured. Multivariate statistical analysis of plasma metabolite profiles demonstrated effects of development and genotype but not gender. Plasma from Callipyge lambs at 12 weeks of age, but not 8 weeks, was characterized by a metabolic profile consistent with contributions from the affected hypertrophic fast twitch glycolytic muscle fibres. We conclude that there is an indirect systemic effect of the Callipyge mutation in skeletal muscle in the form of changes of blood metabolites, which may contribute to secondary phenotypes such as body leanness."

Study Protocol Description	"Blood samples from lambs at 8 and 12 weeks of age were collected into vacutainer tubes containing EDTA. The tubes were gently inverted and centrifuged to isolate the plasma, which was then stored at -80 ºC."	"Not applicable."	"Plasma was thawed at room temperature and 300 µl was mixed with 100 µl of 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 150 µl H2O and 50 µl D2O. Precipitates were removed by centrifugation (12,000 x g) for 5 min, and 550 µl of the supernatant was transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes."	"1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV500 NMR spectrometer operating at a 1H frequency of 500.13 MHz and equipped with a 5 mm self-shielded z-gradient triple resonance probe and a B-ACS 60 sample changer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany)."	"For each plasma sample two types of proton (1H) NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K. (i) 1D NOESY spectra were acquired with the noesypr1d pulse sequence (Bruker Biospin pulse program library). The water signal was suppressed by continuous wave irradiation during both the relaxation delay of 2.3 s and the mixing time (tm) of 100 ms. (ii) Water-suppressed Carr–Purcell–Meibom–Gill (CPMG) spectra were acquired with the cpmgpr1d pulse sequence (Bruker Biospin pulse program library). A fixed spin-spin relaxation delay 2 nt of 60 ms duration (t = 500 µs) was used to eliminate the broad signals from high molecular weight analytes, and water suppression irradiation was applied during the relaxation delay of 2.3 s. For both types of spectra, 256 transients were collected into 32,768 data points using a spectral width of 20.0 ppm. All spectra were processed using TOPSPIN version 2.1 (Bruker Biospin). The free induction delays (FIDs) were multiplied by an exponential window function corresponding to 0.3 Hz line broadening factor before Fourier transformation. The acquired spectra were manually phased and baseline corrected. The spectra of plasma samples were referenced to the anomeric proton of glucose (d = 5.233 ppm)."	"1H NMR spectra were automatically data-reduced to consecutive integral regions of equal width of 0.01 ppm (“buckets”), covering the range of d = 9.0-0.5 ppm, using AMIX (Analysis of Mixtures software package, version 3.6.6, Bruker Biospin). The chemical shift regions at d 6.00-5.60 ppm and d 5.20-4.68 ppm were excluded from the plasma spectra to eliminate artifacts of the urea signal and of imperfect water suppression. The regions at d 3.63-3.60 ppm, 3.23-3.20 ppm, 3.15-3.07 ppm, 2.70-2.68 ppm, and 2.58-2.53 ppm, which contained EDTA signals, were also excluded to avoid these signals affecting the multivariate statistical analysis. For each spectrum, the resulting integral regions were normalized to the total intensity of the spectrum to correct for inter-sample differences in dilution. Subsequently, the bucketed data matrices were imported into the SIMCA-P+12.0 software package (Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden) for multivariate statistical analysis."	"The assignment of peaks to specific metabolites was based on the online databases Human Metabolome Database and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank. Assignments were confirmed by 2-dimensional (2D) 1H-1H double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF–COSY), 1H-1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (13C-HSQC) and 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (13C-HMBC) spectra measured on selected samples."
