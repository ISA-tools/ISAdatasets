STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS288"
Study Title	"Identification of Conserved and Diverse Metabolic Shifts during Rice Grain Development (GC-MS assay)"
Study Description	"Here we investigated the dynamic metabolic changes along the rice grain development of two japonica and two indica cultivars using non-targeted metabolomics approach, in which we successfully identified 214 metabolites. Principal component and clustering analysis revealed both cultivar and developmental stage dependent metabolic changes in rice grains. Generally, the stage specific metabolic kinetics corresponded well to the physiological status of the developing grains, and some of metabolic changes in developing grain of monocot rice are common with those of dicot Arabidopsis and tomato, while others show rice specific patterns. </p>See study MTBLS286 and MYTBLS287 for the LC-MS pos and neg assays respectively for this study."

Study Protocol Description	"Rice plants were planted in a paddy filed in Minghang (31.03 °N, 121.45 °E), Shanghai, China, during the summer season in 2013. Four biological replications of rice seeds at 7, 10, 14, 28 and 42 DAF were collected, immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen, lyophilized for 48 hours and stored at -80 °C until metabolomics analysis."	"20 mg rice grain powder was extracted in a prechilled methanol:chloroform:water extraction solution (1:2.5:1 v/v). Standard (0.2 mg/ml ribitol in water) was subsequently added as a quantification standard. The mixture was extracted for 15 min at 4 °C shaking. After centrifugation at 2,200 x g, 400 ml of water was added to the supernatant. Following vortexing and centrifugation the methanol-water phase was taken and 200 ml reduced to dryness in vacuum. Residues were redissolved and derivatized for 90 min at 37 °C (in 40 µl of 20 mg/ml methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine) followed by a 30-min treatment with 60 µl N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide at 37 °C. 8 µl of a retention time standard mixture (0.029% v/v n-dodecane, n-pentadecane, n-nonadecane, n-docosane, n-octacosane, n-dotracontane, and n-hexatriacontane dissolved in pyridine) was added prior to trimethylsilylation."	"The GC-MS system consisted of an AS 2000 autosampler, a GC 8000 gas chromatograph, and a Voyager quadrupole mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest). GC was performed on a 30 m SPB-50 column with 0.25 mm i.d. and 0.25 m film thickness (Supelco). Injection temperature was 230 °C, the interface set to 250 °C, and the ion source adjusted to 200 °C. The carrier gas used was helium set at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The temperature program was 5 min isothermal heating at 70 °C, followed by a 5 °C/min oven temperature ramp to 310 °C, and a final 1 min heating at 310 °C. The system was then temperature equilibrated for 6 min at 70 °C prior to injection of the next sample. More detailed information can be found in [1].
