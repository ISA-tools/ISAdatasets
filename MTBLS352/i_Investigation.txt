Study Title	"Lipidomic profiling reveals distinct differences in plasma lipid composition in healthy, prediabetic and type 2 diabetic individuals"
Study Description	"The relationship between dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been extensively reported, but the global lipid profiles, especially in the East Asia population, associated with the development of T2D remain to be characterized. Here, we conducted a global lipidomics analysis of 293 Chinese individuals, including 114 T2D patients, 81 prediabetic subjects and 98 individuals with NGT, using DIA-based LC-MS/MS technology. The altered plasma lipidome in Chinese T2D and prediabetic subjects suggest that lipid features may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2D and that such features may provide a basis for evaluation of risk and monitoring of disease development."

Study Protocol Description	"After an overnight fast of at least 10 hrs, four tubes of venous blood samples from each participant were collected for plasma lipidomics (1 tube) and medical tests (3 tubes) including FPG, insulin, C peptide, HbA1c, leptin, adiponectin, blood lipid and routine blood tests. Fasting venous blood samples for plasma lipidomics were immediately centrifuged at 1600 x g for 15 min."	"The collected plasma samples were thawed on ice and lipids were extracted with isopropanol according to the method described previously[1]. Briefly, 40 μl plasma were extracted with 120 μl precooled isopropanol, vortex mixed for 1 min and incubated at room temperature for 10 min, then the extraction mixture was stored overnight at -20 °C. After being centrifuged at 4000 x g for 20 min, the supernatant was transferred into new 96-well plates and diluted 10:1 with IPA/ACN/H2O (2:1:1, v:v:v). The samples were stored at -80 °C before LC-MS analysis. In addition, pooled plasma samples were also prepared by combining 10 μl of each extraction mixture.</br>

"	"Samples were analyzed with an ACQUITY UPLC (Waters, Manchester, USA) connected to a XEVO-G2XS QTOF mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, USA) with electrospray ionization (ESI). Separation of lipids was achieved using an Acquity UPLC CSH C18 column (2.1×100 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters) with a gradient mobile phase comprising of 10 mM ammonium formate with 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile/water (A, 60:40, v/v) and 10 mM ammonium formate with 0.1% formic acid in isopropanol/acetonitrile (B, 90:10, v/v). The mobile phase was delivered at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The column was eluted initially with 40% B and immediately a linear gradient to 43% B over 2 min, then the percentage of B was increased to 50% within 0.1 min. Over the next 3.9 min, the gradient was further ramped to 54% B, and the amount of B was increased to 70% in 0.1 min. In the final part of the gradient, B was increased to 99% in 1.9 min. Finally, B returned to 40% in 0.1 min and equilibrated the column for 1.9 min before the next injection. The injection volume was 10 μl."	"Detection of lipid was performed with XEVO-G2XS QTOF mass spectrometer in positive and negative mode, and operated in MSE mode from m/z 50-2,000 with an acquisition time of 1 s per scan. The source temperature was set at 120 °C. The desolvation temperature and gas flow were 600 °C and  800 l/h, and nitrogen was used as flow gas. The capillary and cone voltage were 2.0 KV (+) / 1.5 KV (-), 30 V, individually. Leucine encephalin (molecular weight (MW) = 555.62) (200 pg/μl in acetonitrile/ water 50:50) was used as a lock mass for accurate mass measurements and 0.5 mM sodium formate solution was used for calibration. Samples were random ordered, and 10 QCs were injected at the beginning to condition the column. To investigate the repeatability of the data, one QC was inserted and analyzed every ten samples."	"UPLC-MS raw data were imported into the Progenesis QI 2.0 data analysis software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK) for peak picking, alignment. Intensity of each peak was normalized with all compounds, and produce peak intensities for retention time and m/z data pairs. Further data preprocessing was performed with the normalized peak intensities using in-house software metaX. To reduce redundant and produce comparable peaks, retention time (0.5-9.0 min) and peak width (1 s-30 s) tolerance were configured with Progenesis QI. To further improve the data quality, the number of zeros being <50% of QC samples or <80% of real samples were removed, the remaining zero values were replaced with kNN algorithm (k-Nearest Neighbor). Principal components analysis (PCA) for outlier detection was also performed with MetaX on the pre-processed dataset. To minimize the signal intensity drift over time, the QC-RLSC (Quality control-based robust LOESS signal correction), which is fitted to the QC data with respect to the order of injection, was conducted. In addition, relative standard deviations (RSD) for metabolic features were calculated across all QC samples. Those features with RSDs >30% were then removed."	"Metabolite identification was conducted by Progenesis Metascope against the HMDB 3.6 (http://www.hmdb.ca/), LIPID MAPS (http://www.lipidmaps.org/) and LipidBlast (http://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/projects/LipidBlast) with mass tolerance of 10 ppm for precursors. The metabolites which could be matched to LIPID MAPS, LipidBlast or aliphatic compounds of HMDB at level of Molecular Framework were considered as lipids and lipid-like features. DDA analysis which covered the desired mass scan range of interested m/z was performed to further aid in metabolite identification. The reported molecules were classified to Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) levels according to the reporting guidelines."
