Study Title	"LipidHunter Identifies Phospholipids by High-Throughput Processing of LC-MS and Shotgun Lipidomics Datasets (Rat cardiomyocyte assay)"
Study Description	"Lipids are dynamic constituents of biological systems, rapidly responding to any changes in physiological conditions. Thus, there is a large interest in lipid-derived markers for diagnostic and prognostic applications, especially in translational and systems medicine research. As lipid identification remains a bottleneck of modern untargeted lipidomics, we developed LipidHunter, a new open source software for the high-throughput identification of phospholipids in data acquired by LC-MS and shotgun experiments. LipidHunter resembles a workflow of manual spectra annotation. Lipid identification is based on MS/MS data analysis in accordance with defined fragmentation rules for each phospholipid (PL) class. The software tool matches product and neutral loss signals obtained by collision-induced dissociation to a user-defined white list of fatty acid residues and PL class-specific fragments. The identified signals are tested against elemental composition and bulk identification provided via LIPID MAPS search. Furthermore, LipidHunter provides information-rich tabular and graphical reports allowing to trace back key identification steps and perform data quality control. Thereby, 202 discrete lipid species were identified in lipid extracts from rat primary cardiomyocytes treated with a peroxynitrite donor. Their relative quantification allowed the monitoring of dynamic reconfiguration of the cellular lipidome in response to mild nitroxidative stress. LipidHunter is available free for download at https://bitbucket.org/SysMedOs/lipidhunter."

Study Protocol Description	"Primary rat cardiomyocytes (Innoprot, Elealde Derio, Spain) were cultured in gelatine-coated 6-well-plates (CELLSTAR, Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frick-enhausen, Germany) in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 5% horse serum, 2 mmol/l L-glutamine, 3 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mmol/l non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C (humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air). When cells reached 80% confluence, medium was replaced by serum-free medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin), and cells were treated with 10 µmol/l SIN-1."	"After 15 min, 30 min, 70 min, or 16 h, plates were placed on ice, and cells were washed with cold PBS containing BHT (0.01%, w/v) and scraped into 1 ml of cold methanol containing acetic acid (3%, v/v) and BHT (0.01% w/v)[1]. Samples were spiked with internal standards [PC(17:0/17:0), PE(17:0/17:0), PS(17:0/17:0), PG(17:0/17:0), PA(17:0/17:0); 100 ng per sample), dried, and resuspended in 50 µl of mixture of water, isopropanol, acetonitrile and methanol (5:3:1:1, by volume).

Eluent A was a mixture of water and acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) containing formic acid (0.1% v/v), and eluent B was a mixture of iso-propanol, acetonitrile, and methanol (60:20:20, v/v/v) containing formic acid (0.1% v/v). Lipids (1 μl in 50% B; each sample in triplicate) were loaded onto a C18-column Acquity UPLC CSH C18 (internal diameter 1.0 mm, length 100 mm, particle diameter 1.7 μm) and eluted with linear gradients from 50 to 90% eluent B (30 min) and to 99% B (1 min) and held for 10 min. Column temperature was set to 50 °C and the flow rate to 60 μl/min."	"Sampling cone voltage was set to 40 V, source offset to 60 V, source temperature to 120 °C, cone gas flow to 30 l/h, desolvation gas flow to 650 l/h, desolvation tempera-ture to 250 °C, nebuliser gas pressure of 6 bar and an ion spray voltage of -2.0 kV. Data were acquired in negative ion data-dependent (DDA) and independent (MSE) resolution modes. In the DDA mode, precursor ion survey scans (scan time 0.5 s) were acquired for m/z 200-1200. Tandem mass spectra (ramp collision energy: LM CE start/end 10-40 and HM CE start/end 20-60) were recorded (scan time 0.25 s) for the 12 most abundant ions in each survey scan using a dynamic exclusion for 30 s. For MSE low (3 V) and high collision energy scans (ramp from 20 to 50 V, scan time 0.6 s) were acquired for m/z 50-1200. The signal of Leu-encephalin (554.26151-) was acquired as lock mass."	"DDA datasets were converted into mzML format using the MSConvert module from ProteoWizard project (version 3.0.9134 64bit, http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net)[1].
