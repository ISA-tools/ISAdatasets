Study Title	"Fetal Metabolic Stress Disrupts Immune Homeostasis and Induces Proinflammatory Responses in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1- and Combination Antiretroviral Therapy-Exposed Infants"
Study Description	"Increased morbidity and fetal growth restriction are reported in uninfected children born to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)–infected women treated with antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Viruses and/or pharmacological interventions such as ARVs can induce metabolic stress, skewing the cell’s immune response and restricting (cell) growth. Novel metabolomic techniques provided the opportunity to investigate the impact of fetal HIV-1 and combination ARV therapy (cART) exposure on the infants’ immune metabolome. Peroxidized lipids, generated by reactive oxygen species, were increased in cART/HIV-1–exposed infants, indicating altered mitochondrial functioning. The lipid metabolism was further dysregulated with increased triglyceride species and a subsequent decrease in phospholipids in cART/HIV-1–exposed infants compared to control infants. Proinflammatory immune mediators, lysophospholipids as well as cytokines such as CXCL10 and CCL3, were increased whereas anti-inflammatory metabolites from the cytochrome P450 pathway were reduced in cART/HIV-1–exposed infants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the fetal metabolism is impacted by maternal factors (cART and HIV-1) and skews physiological immune responses toward inflammation in the newborn infant."

Study Protocol Description	"Plasma was obtained from cord blood collected from 12 infants born to HIV-1-infected women and  from 15 control infants born to HIV-1-negative mothers (and not exposed to cART). The samples were collected at the Academic Medical Center (Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The study was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from participating mothers. For the cART/HIV-1-exposed group, maternal viral load, CD4+ T cell count, total triglyceride, total cholesterol and antiretroviral medications were obtained from the patient hospital records (Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). Total triglyceride and total cholesterol levels where not available for the control group. The cART regimen that was used for each patient (Table S1) was based on viral resistance or the patient’s treatment regimen prior to conception. Per European guidelines, the cART regimen consisted of two NRTI’s (primarily zidovudine and lamivudine) and either a protease inhibitor (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir or nelfinavir) or an NNRTI (nevirapine). 5 of the 12 women were receiving cART treatment prior to pregnancy. 1 patient took tenofovir during the first trimester of pregnancy combined with lamivudine and nevirapine, while another received nevirapine (NNRTI), in combination with ritonavir boosted lopinavir and saquinavir due to her resistance profile. During birth, all HIV-1-infected mothers were given intrapartum zidovudine. The clinical profile at delivery of the 12 mothers in the study indicates that the virus was suppressed appropriately, consistent with a mother-to-child transmission rate of <1%. HIV-1 infection was evaluated at birth, 5 weeks and 3 months by measuring RNA viral load with PCR and confirmed at 18 months of age, by showing absence of detectable HIV immunoglobulin G. All infants were confirmed to be HIV-1–negative.
</p>
Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at –20 °C prior to analysis and transported to the Biomedical Facility Leiden (Leiden University) for metabolomics analysis."	"Non-polar lipid (positive) profiling:</br>
Positive lipids were extracted with isopropyl alcohol (IPA). In short, 1000 µl IPA containing calibrant and internal standards both at C4 levels were added to 10 µl serum to precipitate proteins. After centrifugation (12.100 rpm, 10 mins, at RT) supernatant containing the lipids is transferred to vials for LC-MS analysis. In total 2.5 µl was injected for analysis.
</p>
Polar lipid (negative) profiling:</br>
Polar lipid extraction is performed by methanol extraction. Briefly, 440 µl methanol containing internal standard is added to 20 µl serum. After centrifugation, the protein is precipitated and the lipid containing supernatant is transferred to clean Eppendorf tubes and the solvent is evaporated using a Speedvac. The dried lipids were reconstituted in 145 µl IPA, 0.1% formic acid and transferred to autosampler vials. In total 8 µl was injected for analysis.
</p>
Oxylipin profiling:</br>
Antioxidant mixture (5 µl) (0.4 mg/ml BHT and 0.4 mg/ml EDTA mixed with volume ratio 1:1) and a mixture of internal-standard mixtures (ISTDs) (5 µl, 1000nM) were added into each 150 µl aliquot of cordblood plasma. Subsequently the samples were loaded on the activated SPE plates (Oasis-HLB 96-well plates, 60mg, 30µm) and eluted using ethyl acetate (1.5ml). The dried eluate was re-dissolved in 50 µl acetonitrile/methanol (50:50 v/v) and 5 µl were used for HPLC analysis.
</p>
Quality Control Samples:</br>
Quality control (QC) samples were used during the metabolomics analyses. Equal volumes of each study sample were pooled to generate a QC pool. A set of QC samples was then included in the analyses with the experimental groups on the individual metabolomics platforms, and the QC samples were distributed randomly through the samples prior to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. In addition, independent duplicate samples were randomly selected. Only those metabolites for which the duplicate and QC samples had a relative standard deviation <30% were considered to be measured accurately."	"Non-polar lipid (positive) profiling:</br>
Chromatographic separation was achieved on a ACQUITY UPLC™ HSS T3 column (1.8 µm, 2.1 x 100mm) with a flow of 0.4 ml/min over a 16 min gradient.
</p>
Polar lipid (negative) profiling:</br>
Chromatographic separation was achieved on a ACQUITY UPLC™ HSS T3 column (1.8 µm, 2.1 x 100mm) with a flow of 0.4 ml/min over 15 min gradient.
</p>
Oxylipin profiling:</br>
Separation was done by HPLC (Agilent 1290, San Jose, CA, USA) using an Ascentis® Express column (2.1 x 150 mm, 2.7 µm particles; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) with 0.35 ml flow during 28 min gradient."	"Non-polar lipid (positive) profiling:</br>
The lipid analysis is performed on a UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF (Agilent 6530, Jose, CA, USA) high resolution mass spectrometer using reference mass correction. Lipids were detected in full scan in the positive ion mode.
</p>
Polar lipid (negative) profiling:</br>
Free fatty acids and lyso-phospholipids content are analyzed with a UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF (Agilent 6530, Jose, CA, USA) high resolution mass spectrometer using reference mass correction. Polar lipids were detected in full scan in the negative ion mode.
</p>
Oxylipin profiling:</br>
The HPLC was coupled to electrospray ionization on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent 6460, San Jose, CA, USA). Oxylipins were detected in negative ion mode using dynamic Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)."	"Non-polar lipid (positive) and polar lipid (negative) profiling:</br>
The raw data were pre-processed using Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis software (Agilent, Version B.04.00). Lipid species were identified using accurate mass. The lipid response was calculated as the peak area ratios of the target analyte to the respective internal standard. Subsequently, an in-house developed QC tool was used to correct for instrument drift and batch effects. The reliability of the measurements was assessed by calculating the reproducibility of each metabolite in a QC pool, which was measured after every 10 samples.
</p>
Oxylipin profiling:</br>
Peak areas were exported from Mass Hunter software (Agilent Technologies, version B.05.01) and ratios to internal standards were computed (target compounds/ ISTDs). Subsequently, an in-house developed QC tool was used to correct for instrument drift and batch effects. The reliability of the measurements was assessed by calculating the reproducibility of each metabolite in a QC pool, which was measured after every 10 samples. 30 unique oxylipins out of a target list of 110 oxylipins included in the metabolomics platform met the criteria RSD-QC <35%."	"Non-polar lipid (positive) and polar lipid (negative) profiling:</br>
Lipid species were identified based on accurate mass.
</p>
Oxylipin profiling:</br>
MRM transitions were achieved by flow injection of pure standards and the optimizer application and were compared to literature. Then the MRM transitions were used for identification of each compound. 
</p>
Data analysis:</br>
A combination of univariate bioinformatics approaches was performed using the R script-based online tool Metaboanalyst 3.0, a comprehensive tool suitable for analyzing metabolomics data. Mann-Whitney U-test, and Fisher's exact test were used to compare differences in patient demographics on continues and categorical variables respectively using SPSS version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated using SPSS. Significant Pearson correlations between immunological markers and metabolites were visualized using the Metscape application within Cytoscape (v3.2.1)
</p>
Following LC-MS analysis, peak integration, and determination of the relative ratios between metabolites and their corresponding internal standards, QC quality assurance was performed. First, we evaluated for outlier samples based on a 95% confidence region in a Hotelling’s T-squared distribution test. No outlier samples were identified in all the platforms measured. Significant metabolites were identified based on the following 2 criteria: (1) a fold change (FC) =1.25 or =0.75, indicating a 25% increase or decrease, respectively, and (2) a p-value <0.05 using the Mann-Whitney U test. The significant univariate results are shown on a volcano plot as coloured symbols. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were generated using log-transformed normalized data in SPSS. During the correlation analyses, each metabolite was tested against 8 immunological markers, and no multiple testing correction was performed, as only class responses—and not individual correlations—were interpreted. Significant correlations were defined as a Pearson’s coefficient (r) >0.46 or r <-0.46 and p<0.05."
