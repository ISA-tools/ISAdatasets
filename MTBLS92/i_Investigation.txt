Study Identifier	"MTBLS92"
Study Title	"Monounsaturated fatty acids in serum triacylglycerols are associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients"
Study Description	"Changes in cellular lipid metabolism are a common feature in most solid tumors, which occur already in early stages of the tumor progression. However, it remains unclear if the tumor-specific lipid changes can be detected at the level of systemic lipid metabolism. The objective of this study was to perform comprehensive analysis of lipids in breast cancer patient serum samples. Lipidomic profiling using an established analytical platform was performed in two cohorts of breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The analyses were performed for 142 patients before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the results before chemotherapy were validated in an independent cohort of 194 patients. The analyses revealed that in general the tumor characteristics are not reflected in the serum samples. However, there was an association of specific triacylglycerols (TGs) in patients' response to chemotherapy. These TGs containing mainly oleic acid (C18:1) were found in lower levels in those patients showing pathologic complete response before receiving chemotherapy. Some of these TGs were also associated with estrogen receptor status and overall or disease-free survival of the patients. The results suggest that the altered serum levels of oleic acid in breast cancer patients are associated with their response to chemotherapy."

Study Protocol Description	"The samples used in our study were obtained from the neoadjuvant GeparQuattro trial, which was a multicenter, prospective, randomized Phase III trial with 1,495 patients with locally advanced, operable tumors. The patients were randomized into three arms: 4 x epirubicine, cyclophosphamide (EC) -> docetaxel (D) vs. 4 x EC -> 4 x D/capecitabine (C) vs. 4 x EC -> 4 x D -> 4 x C. In addition, all HER2-positive patients (according to local pathology) received trastuzumab. Eligibility criteria and details of the trial have been described previously [1]. The protocol was reviewed by all responsible local ethics committees and informed consent was obtained from the patients. One of the secondary endpoints of the trial was the investigation of biomarkers capable of predicting therapy response. Tissue, blood and serum were collected at baseline (BL) as well as at the time of surgery (OP). In our study, we used two cohorts of nonfasting serum samples. The global lipidomic analysis was performed for the discovery cohort comprising 142 BL and 111 OP samples, and an additional cohort of 194 BL samples was used for the validation. The blood samples were collected during several years, centrifuged immediately and stored at -20 °C at the site for no longer than month. After that the serum samples were centrally stored at -80 °C until used for the analyses.

"10 µl of serum was extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1; 100 µl) after adding an internal standard mixture with PC(17:0/0:0), Cer(d18:1/17:0), PC(17:0/17:0), PE(17:0/17:0) and TG(17:0/17:0/17:0) at a concentration level of 0.2 µg per sample. The samples were vortexed for 2 min, incubated for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 3 min. A labeled lipid standard mixture containing PC(16:1-D3/0:0), PC(16:1/16:1-D6) and TG(16:0/16:0/16:0–13C3) at a concentration level of 0.1 µg per sample was added into the separated lipid extracts (100 µl) before UPLC-MS analysis."	"Lipid extracts were analyzed on a Waters Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer combined with an Acquity Ultra Performance LCTM (UPLC™). The column (at 50 °C) was an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 2.1 mm x 100 mm with 1.7-µm particles. The solvent system was (A) ultrapure water (1% 1 M NH4Ac and 0.1% HCOOH) and (B) LC/MS-grade acetonitrile/isopropanol (1:1, 1% 1M NH4Ac and 0.1% HCOOH) and the gradient started from 65% A/35% B, reached 80% B in 2 min, 100% B in 7 min and remained there for 7 min. The flow rate was 0.400 ml/min and 2 µl aliquot was injected (Acquity Sample Organizer, at 10 °C)."	"Lipid extracts were analyzed on a Waters Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer combined with an Acquity Ultra Performance LCTM (UPLC™). Reserpine was used as the lock spray reference compound. The data were collected at mass range of m/z 200–1,200 with scan duration of 0.2 sec in positive ion mode."	"The data were processed using MZmine 2 software."	"The lipid identifications were based on an internal spectral library. The lipidomic data used for statistical analyses were expressed as µmol/l.
</p>
Statistical analyses:</br>
All the statistical analyses were performed with R version 2.15.2. The UPLC-MS lipidomics data were log2-transformed for all the analyses. The effect of chemotherapy and menopausal status on lipid profiles was investigated by using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and by projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) method using mixOmics package. The univariate analyses of two-group comparisons were performed either with paired or unpaired t-tests, as appropriate, or in case of many groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Interaction between two variables was investigated using two-way ANOVA. To control for multiple hypothesis testing errors false-discovery rate q-values were estimated using the qvalue package. Correlations were calculated using Pearson method. Beanplots were drawn using the beanplot package. In this article, the threshold for statistical significance is p<0.05 and for marginal significance p<0.10."
