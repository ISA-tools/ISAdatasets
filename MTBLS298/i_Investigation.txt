Study Title	"Genome-scale study reveals reduced metabolic adaptability in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"
Study Description	"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major risk factor leading to chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes. Here we chart liver metabolic activity and functionality in NAFLD by integrating global transcriptomic data, from human liver biopsies, and metabolic flux data, measured across the human splanchnic vascular bed, within a genome-scale model of human metabolism. We show that an increased amount of liver fat induces mitochondrial metabolism, lipolysis, glyceroneogenesis and a switch from lactate to glycerol as substrate for gluconeogenesis, indicating an intricate balance of exacerbated opposite metabolic processes in glycemic regulation. These changes were associated with reduced metabolic adaptability on a network level in the sense that liver fat accumulation puts increasing demands on the liver to adaptively regulate metabolic responses to maintain basic liver functions. We propose that failure to meet excessive metabolic challenges coupled with reduced metabolic adaptability may lead to a vicious pathogenic cycle leading to the co-morbidities of NAFLD."

Study Protocol Description	"The subjects were studied after an overnight fast. Three intravenous cannulas were inserted as described earlier5. Shortly, the first was inserted in an antecubital vein for infusions of saline (first 90 min), glucose, insulin, and potassium-[2,2-2H2]palmitate, the second was inserted in a contralateral arm and the third catheter was inserted percutaneously under local anaesthesia into a femoral vein. Hepatic blood flow was measured using a constant i.v. infusion of indocyanine green (ICG). Plasma glucose was maintained at 5 mmol/liter (90 mg/dl) until 240 min using a variable rate infusion of 20% glucose. Potassium-[2,2-2H2]palmitate bound to human albumin was infused at a rate of 0.05 µmol/kg/min starting at 30 min to trace FFA and TG metabolism in vivo. Hepatic blood flow was measured at 90, 100, 110, 120, 200, 220, 240 min. During the saline and insulin infusion, arterialized and hepatic vein plasma samples were taken at 10-60 min intervals.
</p>
The fat content of the liver biopsy specimens (% of hepatocytes with macrovesicular steatosis) was determined by an experienced liver pathologist in a blinded fashion. The % of macrovesicular steatosis was used as the liver fat %."	"Each serum sample (20 µl) was spiked with internal standard (20 µl labeled palmitic acid, c=258 mg/l) and the mixture was then extracted with 400 µl of methanol. After centrifugation the supernatant was evaporated to dryness and the original metabolites were then converted into their methoxime and trimethylsilyl derivative(s) by two-step derivatization. First, 25 µl methoxamine reagent was added to the residue and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 45 °C. Next, 25 µl N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide was added and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 45 ºC. Finally, retention index standard mixture (n-alkanes) in hexane was added to the mixture."	"Leco Pegasus 4D GC×GC-TOFMS instrument (Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI) equipped with a cryogenic modulator was used. The GC part of the instrument was an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), equipped with split/splitless injector. The first-dimension chromatographic column was a 10 m RTX-5 capillary column with an internal diameter of 0.18 mm and a stationary-phase film thickness of 0.20 µm, and the second-dimension chromatographic column was a 1.5 m BPX-50 capillary column with an internal diameter of 100 µm and a film thickness of 0.1 µm. A diphenyltetramethyldisilazane deactivated retention gap (3 m x 0.53 mm i.d.) was used in the front of the first column. High-purity helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant pressure mode (39.6 psig). A 5 s separation time was used in the second dimension."	"The mass spectra were recorded by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV in the m/z range of 45 – 700 amu with 100 spectra/sec on a Leco Pegasus 4D GC×GC-TOFMS instrument. Split injection (1 µl, split ratio 1:20) at 260 °C was used. The temperature program was as follows: the first-dimension column oven ramp began at 50 °C with a 1 min hold after which the temperature was programmed to 295 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and then held at this temperature for 3 min. The second-dimension column temperature was maintained 20 °C higher than the corresponding first-dimension column. The programming rate and hold times were the same for the two columns."	"Data transformation
The original GC×GC-TOFMS data included retention times, retention indices (RI), spectral information, possible identification, spectral similarity value (S=0-1000) and peak response data. The linear retention indexes were calculated based on the retention times of the compounds and the retention times of the retention index standards (n-alkanes). The data were transferred into an in-house developed program Guineu25. The alignment of the data was done based on the two retention times and spectra. After alignment of the GC×GC-TOFMS data, two filtration criteria were used for positive identification: 1) spectral match < 850 and 2) the RIexp-RIlit  < 25 or RIexp-RIstd_exp < 25, in which RIexp is the experimental RI for a compound and RIlit  is the literature value for the identified compound and RIstd_exp is the experimental RI value for a standard compound. Compounds not fulfilling the criteria were renamed to unknowns and were subjected to further identification. 
</p>
Calibration curves (six points, c=15-2000 ng, cholesterol c=170-6000 ng) were constructed for the following compounds: pyruvic acid, alanine, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, glycine, succinic acid, fumaric acid, serine, threonine, malic acid, methionine, aspartic acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, ornithine, citric acid, tyrosine, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, arachidonic acid, and  cholesterol."	"The identification was based on the spectral search from NIST library or the in-house collected library and the retention indices. The compounds for which no spectral match was found by the two libraries, GOLM database (http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de) was utilized. The database was also used for functional group prediction of the metabolites."
