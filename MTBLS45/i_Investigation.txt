Study Title	"Metabolomic correlation-network modules in Arabidopsis based on a graph-clustering approach"
Study Description	"Deciphering the metabolome is essential for a better understanding of the cellular metabolism as a system. Typical metabolomics data show a few but significant correlations among metabolite levels when data sampling is repeated across individuals grown under strictly controlled conditions. Although several studies have assessed topologies in metabolomic correlation networks, it remains unclear whether highly connected metabolites in these networks have specific functions in known tissue- and/or genotype-dependent biochemical pathways. In our study of metabolite profiles we subjected root tissues to gas chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) and used published information on the aerial parts of 3 Arabidopsis genotypes, Col-0 wild-type, methionine over-accumulation 1 (mto1), and transparent testa4 (tt4) to compare systematically the metabolomic correlations in samples of roots and aerial parts. We then applied graph clustering to the constructed correlation networks to extract densely connected metabolites and evaluated the clusters by biochemical-pathway enrichment analysis. We found that the number of significant correlations varied by tissue and genotype and that the obtained clusters were significantly enriched for metabolites included in biochemical pathways. We demonstrate that the graph-clustering approach identifies tissue- and/or genotype-dependent metabolomic clusters related to the biochemical pathway. Metabolomic correlations complement information about changes in mean metabolite levels and may help to elucidate the organization of metabolically functional modules."

Study Protocol Description	"As described in [1], wild-type A.thaliana plants accession Columbia (Col-0) and the mutants mto1 and tt4 of Col-0 background were obtained from Dr. Naito, Hokkaido University, and Dr. Kitamura, Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, respectively. The sterilized seeds were stratified at 5 °C for 2 d, and were successively sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 1% sucrose. Plants were cultivated in controlled growth chambers at 22 °C in 16-h light and 8-h dark conditions for 18 d. For metabolomic correlation analysis we sampled tissues from the roots. The number of biological replicates in roots was 53 (WT, n = 17; mto1, n = 16; and tt4, n = 20). We pooled 3 root samples as a batch for metabolite profiling.

Each isotope was adjusted to a final concentration of 22.5 ng per µl injection. After centrifugation for 5 min at 15,100 x g, 400 µl of the supernatant was used for further analysis. The extracts were evaporated to dryness in a Savant SPD2010 SpeedVac Concentrator (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA).

Derivatization:</br>
For methoximation, 20 µl of methoxyamine hydrochloride (20 mg/ml in pyridine) was added to the sample. After 30 h of derivatization at room temperature, the sample was trimethylsilylated for 1 h using 20 µl of MSTFA with 1% TMCS at 37 °C with shaking. Twenty µl of n-heptane was added following silylation. All the derivatization steps were performed in the vacuum glove box VSC-100 (Sanplatec, Japan) filled with 99.9995% (G3 grade) of dry nitrogen.

Four replicates were subjected to 1D-GC-TOF/MS analysis. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The temperature program for metabolome analysis started with a 2 min isothermal step at 80 °C and this was followed by temperature ramping at 30 °C to a final temperature of 320 °C, which was maintained for 3.5 min.

Alkane standard mixtures (C8–C20 and C21–C40) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Tokyo, Japan) and were used for calculating the retention index (RI). The normalized response for the calculation of the signal intensity of each metabolite from the mass-detector response was obtained by each selected ion current that was unique in each metabolite MS spectrum to normalize the peak response, using the method of Kopka et al [2]. The normalized responses are peak areas corrected using the sample weight and a constant amount of the representative internal standard compound ([¹³C₄]-hexadecanoic acid).

"Nonprocessed MS data from GC-TOF/MS analysis were exported in NetCDF format to MATLAB 6.5 (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA), where all data-pretreatment procedures, such as smoothing, alignment, time-window setting, and H-MCR, were carried out."	"The resolved MS spectra were matched against reference mass spectra using the NIST mass spectral search program for the NIST/EPA/NIH mass spectral library (version 2.0) and our custom software for peak annotation written in JAVA. Peaks were identified or annotated based on retention indices (RIs) and the reference mass spectra comparison to the Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) and our in-house spectral library.The amount of S-adenosyl-methionine was calculated by the sum of the mass numbers at m/z 188 and 236 using Leco ChromaTOF software version 2.32 (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) since this compound was not adequately detected by H-MCR.

Statistical analysis:</br>
Metabolomic data were log2 transformed and then statistically analyzed using the rank product method to identify differentially changed metabolites with the Bioconductor 'RankProd' package. Significantly changed metabolites showed a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. The FDR value in the rank product was obtained with 1,000 random permutations. PCA was performed with the Bioconductor 'pcaMethods' package. To reduce outlier-related artifacts, the Spearman rank correlation (r), which is relatively robust to outliers and is based only on monotonicity, was used for comparative metabolomic correlations. To identify differences between correlations, we tested whether two correlations manifested different strengths using Fisher Z-transformation. The local false-discovery rate (fdr) was determined with the 'fdrtool' package. The significance level was set at fdr < 0.05. All statistical tests were performed with the R program http://www.r-project.org/.  To identify co-accumulated metabolite groups we used DPClus, a graph clustering algorithm that can extract densely connected nodes as a cluster. It is based on density- and periphery tracking of clusters. DPClus is freely available from http://kanaya.naist.jp/DPClus/. In this study, we used the overlapping-mode with the DPClus settings because we are confident that extracting clusters with the overlapping-mode is consistent with the overlapping of many of the metabolic pathways and protein complexes. We set the parameter settings of cluster property cp; density values were set to 0.5. To assess the statistical significance of clusters obtained by graph clustering, we subjected datasets of the aerial parts and roots of the 3 Arabidopsis genotypes and 100 randomly-generated sets of clusters to KEGG enrichment."
