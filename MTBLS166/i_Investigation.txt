Study Identifier	"MTBLS166"
Study Title	"1H NMR and LC–MS/MS based urine metabolomic investigation of the subacute effects of HBCD in mice"
Study Description	"In present study, a 1H NMR based untargeted metabolomics approach was used to evaluate the subacute effects of oral gavage adminstration of HBCD (10mg/kg, 50mg/kg) on mice urine metabolome. Multivariate statistical analysis by PLS-DA showed that the metabolites in exposure groups were clearly distinct from those of control group. The distinguishing metabolites citric acid and 2-ketoglutarate were significantly up-regulated, displaying the disturbance of energy metabolism after HBCD treatment. While some metabolites including acetic acid, malonic acid and 3-hydroxybutyrate were reduced in low or high dosed groups，indicating the impaired lipid metabolism. Other influenced metabolites consisted of formate, trimethylamine and several amino acids. Furthermore, a targeted UPLC-MS/MS method was performed for metabolic profiling of twenty amino acids. Quantitation results identified alanine, lysine and phenylalanine as significantly disturbed amino acids. Overall, these results suggested that subchronic exposure to HBCD caused a disturbance of mice metabolism, especially in TCA cycle, lipid metabolism and homeostasis of amino acids, and the analysis of metabolic profiles can provide more comprehensive information for risk assessment of environment pollutants."

Study Protocol Description	""	"Two hundred microliters (200μL) of phosphate buffer (PH=7.4) was mixed with 400μL urine to minimize variation in urine PH, and the mixture was allowed to centrifuge at 12000rpm for 5min. Then 50μL TSP-d4/D2O (29.02mM) solution was added to the supernatant. The TSP acted as a chemical shift reference (δ0.0) and the D2O provided a lock signal"	"NMR spectra of these samples were recorded on a BRUKER AVANCEⅢ600 spectrometer at 298 K"	"All 1D 1H NMR spectra were obtained using a 1D NOESY pulse sequence with the spectral width of 20ppm. The water resonance was preferentially presaturated during relaxation delay and mixing time and additional spoil gradients. For each spectrum, a relaxation delay of 4 s, an acquisition time of 2.66 s, and a mixing time of 0.01 s was performed to collect 128 transient scans into 64K data points."	"All 1H NMR spectra were baseline and phased corrected using TopSpin3.0 (Bruker Biospin, Germany), then data were integrated between 0.2 and 10.0 ppm over a series of 0.04 ppm integral regions using AMIX (version 3.9.11). The δ6.1−4.7 region was excluded prior to statistical analysis due to the residue of water resonance. To account for dilution or bulk mass variations between urine samples, the integral regions was normalized to the total spectra area. Data sets were then imported into SIMCA package (Version 11, Umetrics, Sweden) to conduct a multivariate analysis"	"The metabolite resonances were identified according to information from HMDB (Human Metabolome Database) and MMCD (Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database). The biological pathway analysis was conducted based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database."	""	""	" Mice were administrated by oral gavage for consecutive 28 days with 10mg/kg and 50mg/kg body weight in dosed groups. The control group was treated with an equivalent volume of corn oil. Individual urine sample of 24 hours following the final dose of 28 days were collected by metabolic cage. Then the supernatant liquor was separated by centrifuge at 12000rpm for 5min and urine samples were stored at -20℃ for further NMR and LC-MS/MS analysis."
