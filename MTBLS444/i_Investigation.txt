Study Title	"Quantitative metabolomic analysis of the human cornea and aqueous humor"
Study Description	"INTRODUCTION: Cornea is the outermost part of the eye supplied mostly by aqueous humor (AH). Therefore, the comparison of the metabolomic compositions of AH and cornea may help to determine which compounds are produced inside the cornea, and which penetrate into cornea from AH for intra-corneal consumption. Keratoconus (KC) is the most common form of the cornea dystrophy, and the analysis of KC corneas can unravel the metabolomic changes occurring in AH and cornea of KC patients. </br> OBJECTIVES: The work is aimed at the determination of concentrations of a wide range of metabolites in the human cornea and AH, the comparison of the metabolomic profiles of cornea and AH, and the comparison of the metabolomic compositions of samples taken from KC patients and normal donors (post-mortem). </br> METHODS: The quantitative metabolomic profiling was carried out with the use of two independent methods—high-frequency 1H NMR spectroscopy and HPLC with high-resolution ESI-MS detection. </br> RESULTS: The concentrations of 71 most abundant metabolites in cornea and AH from keratoconus patients and from human cadavers have been measured. It is found that the concentrations of purines and organic acids in cornea are significantly higher than in AH. The KC corneas are characterized by the enhanced levels of acetate and citrate, and also by low values of GSH/GSSG ratios. </br> CONCLUSION: A significant difference in the metabolomic compositions of the human AH and cornea has been revealed. The concentrations of glucose and some amino acids in cornea are significantly lower than in AH, indicating their fast consumption inside the cornea. The high levels of organic acids, purines and GSH in cornea should be attributed to their production in the cornea. The enhanced levels of acetate and citrate as well as the low values of GSH/GSSG ratios in KC corneas are the indicators of the oxidative stress. </br>"

Study Protocol Description	"The research followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and the ethical approval from International Tomography Center. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients after explanation of the nature and possible consequences of the study.
</p>
The samples of cornea (buttons of 7.8 mm in diameter) and aqueous humor (AH) from patients were collected at the “Eye Microsurgery” clinic (Novosibirsk, Russia) from 11 non-diabetic individuals off both genders with diagnosed keratoconus and undergoing corneal transplantation (age 22-51 years, average age 31). The post-mortem samples of cornea and AH from cadavers (7-24 hrs post-mortem) were provided by the Novosibirsk Clinical Bureau of Forensic Medical Examination. A total of 13 donors were of both genders, aged 19-81 years (average age 48 years). The wet weights of obtained tissues have been measured, than the samples were frozen and stored at -70 °C until analyzed."	"To obtain the protein-free extracts of aqueous humor (AH), 4 vol of 100% EtOH were added to 1 vol of thawed AH samples. The corneas were weighed and then homogenized in 700 µl EtOH. The samples were placed in a shaker for 20 min, and then centrifuged (12,000 x g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatants were collected. The pellet for corneas was re-extracted with 700 ml 80% EtOH, and supernatants were pooled together.
</p>
To remove lipids from the cornea extracts, 300 µl CHCl3 was added to 600 µl of the protein-free extract, the sample was shaken for 10 min. 300 µl H2O was added, the sample was shaken for 20 min, and left at -20 °C for 30 min. The sample was centrifuged (12,000 x g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the aqueous (upper) fraction was collected. The procedure was repeated 1 more time. The obtained protein-free and lipid-free extract was divided into 2 parts in the ratio 2:1, the larger part was used for NMR measurements, and the lesser part – for LC-MS measurements. The AH protein-free extracts were analyzed without the delipidation procedure."	"The extracts for NMR measurements were lyophilized, re-dissolved in 500 µl of D2O containing 6 x 10^-6 M sodium 3-trimethylsilylpropane-1-sulfonate (DSS) as an internal standard and 20 mM deuterated phosphate buffer to maintain pH 7.4 and placed into a standard 5 mm glass NMR tube."	"All NMR measurements were carried out with the use of a AVANCE III HD 700 MHz (Bruker BioSpin, Germany) NMR spectrometer equipped with a 16.44 T Ascend cryomagnet and 5 mm TXI ATMA NMR probe."	"The proton NMR spectra for each sample were obtained with 200 accumulations. Temperature of the sample during the data acquisition was kept at 25 ºC, the pulse sequence was zgpr, the detection pulse was 90 degree. The repetition time between scans was 30 s to allow for the complete relaxation of all spins. Low power radiation at the water resonance frequency was applied prior to acquisition to presaturate the water signal."	"The baseline processing and integration were done using the ACD/NMR Processor Academic Edition."	"The signal assignment was confirmed by the addition of standard samples into extract solutions. The concentrations of metabolites in the samples were determined by the peak area integration respectively to the internal standard DSS."
