STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS88"
Study Title	"Unexpected similarities between the Schizosaccharomyces and human blood metabolomes, and novel human metabolites (Blood plasma and RBC fractions)"
Study Description	"Metabolomics, a new branch of chemical biology, provides compositional and quantitative information about the state of organism or cell at the levels of metabolite constituents. We here report non-targeted metabolome of human blood that is made up of plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), using liquid-chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Previously, metabolome of a microbe, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, was reported. Two sets of metabolome results are highly similar in their compositions: among 133 compounds identified in human blood, 101 (75%) are also present in S. pombe, and among 57 compounds enriched in RBC, 45 (78%) are also present in S. pombe. Most abundant metabolites are ATP, glutathione and glutamine. Many of other relatively abundant metabolites identified are also implicated in energy, anti-oxidant and amino acid metabolism. We show fourteen newly-identified blood compounds; citramalate, GDP-glucose, trimethyl-histidine, trimethyl-phenylalanine, trimethyl-tryptophan, trimethyl-tyrosine, UDP-acetyl-glucosamine, UDP-glucuronate, dimethyl-lysine, glutamate methyl ester, N-acetyl-(iso)leucine, N-acetyl-glutamate, N2-acetyl-lysine, and N6-acetyl-lysine (the first eight are enriched in RBC). Ten of them are also detected in S. pombe, and ten of them are methylated or acetylated, amino acids. Trimethylated or acetylated free amino acids are also abundant in white blood cell. Their physiologic role may be investigated in the future by yeast genetics. </p> Blood was separated by low speed (120 x g) centrifugation for 15 min. Resulting supernatant (plasma fraction) and pellet (RBC fraction) were collected (each 0.2 ml). Blood was donated four times within 24 hours bysingle person, samples were processed separetely. By measuring metabolites we could determine their distribution between plasma and RBC fractions."

Study Protocol Description	"Three healthy male and one female volunteers (23–33 years old) participated in this study. Blood samples for metabolomic analysis were taken in the morning and subjects were asked not to eat breakfast to ensure at least 12 h of fasting prior to sampling. Blood samples for metabolomic analysis were drawn by venipuncture into 5 ml heparinized tubes (Terumo). Immediately, 0.2 ml blood samples were quenched in 1.8 ml of 55% methanol at -40 °C. The remainder of each blood sample was centrifuged at 120 x g for 15 min at room temperature to separate plasma and Red Blood Cells. After centrifugation, 0.2 ml of separated plasma and RBCs, respectively, was quenched in 1.8 ml of 55% methanol at -40 °C."	"Ten nmol each of HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) and PIPES (piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)) was added to each sample to serve as standards. After brief vortexing, the samples were transferred to Amicon Ultra 10 kDa cut-off filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove proteins and cell debris. Following sample concentration by vacuum evaporation, each sample was re-suspended in 40 µl of 50% acetonitrile and 1 µl (equivalent to 5 µl of initial sample) was used for each injection into the LC-MS system."	"LC-MS data were obtained using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), as described previously [1]. Briefly, metabolites were separated on a ZIC-pHILIC column (Merck SeQuant, Sweden; 150 x 2.1 mm, 5 µm particle size) using acetonitrile (A) and 10 mM ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 9.3 (B) as the mobile phase, with gradient elution from 80% A to 20% A in 30 min, at a flow rate of 100 µl/min. Sample injection volume was 1 µl per run.

Each sample was analyzed twice, once in negative and once in positive ionization mode."	"Peak areas of metabolites of interest, within the raw LC-MS data, were measured using the MZmine 2.10 software and normalized using the peak areas of HEPES and PIPES. The complete workflow and processing parameters are summarized in the publication."	"Metabolites were identified by comparing their m/z values and retention times with authentic pure standards. If no standard was available, metabolites were assigned by analysis of MS/MS spectra (MS/MS), as described in the publication. In cases where no standard compound or MS/MS spectrum was available, compounds were identified by generating chemical formulae using m/z values in MZmine 2.10 module and given MS status."
