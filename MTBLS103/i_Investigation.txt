Study Title	"Metabolomics reveals impaired maturation of HDL particles in adolescents with hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess"
Study Description	"Hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess (HIAE) in prepubertal and pubertal girls usually precedes a broader pathological phenotype in adulthood that is associated with anovulatory infertility, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. The metabolic derangements that determine these long-term health risks remain to be clarified. Here we use NMR and MS-based metabolomics to show that serum levels of methionine sulfoxide in HIAE girls are an indicator of the degree of oxidation of methionine-148 residue in apolipoprotein-A1. Oxidation of apo-A1 in methionine-148, in turn, leads to an impaired maturation of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) that is reflected in a decline of large HDL particles. Notably, such metabolic alterations occur in the absence of impaired glucose tolerance, hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and were partially restored after 18 months of treatment with a low-dose combination of pioglitazone, metformin and flutamide."

Study Protocol Description	"The study population consisted of 12 non-obese adolescents (age, 16.3±0.4 yr; BMI, 22.8±0.5 kg/m2) diagnosed with HIAE and 14 age-, weight- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls.
</p>
Untargeted metabolomic analyses on serum samples of HIAE and control patients were performed using two analytical platforms: 1H-NMR and LC-ESI-QTOF. Each serum sample was split into two aliquots and run in parallel using the two analytical platforms."	"The second aliquot was used for LC-MS analysis. 30 µl of serum sample was mixed with 120 µl of cold ACN/H2O (1:1) with 1% meta-phosphoric acid (MPA) and 0.1% formic acid (previously filtered). Samples were vortexed vigorously for 30 s and stored at –20 °C for 2 hr to enable protein precipitation. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged 15 min at 4 °C and 22600 RCF and the supernatant was transferred to a LC-MS vial."	"For the NMR measurement 250 µl of serum were mixed with 250 µl of phosphate buffer (0.75 mM Na2HPO4 adjusted at pH 7.4, and 20% D2O to provide the field frequency lock). The final solution was transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube and kept refrigerated at 4 °C in the autosampler until the analysis."	"1H-NMR spectra were recorded at 310 K on a Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 600.20 MHz using a 5 mm CPTCI triple resonance (1H, 13C, 31P)."	"Two different 1H-NMR pulse experiments were performed for each sample: 1) Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY)-presaturation sequence to suppress the residual water peak; and 2) Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence (CPMG, spin-spin T2 relaxation filter) with a total time filter of 410 ms to attenuate the signals of serum macro-molecules to a residual level; 20 ppm spectral width and a total of 64 transients collected into 64 k data points."	"Samples were injected in a UHPLC system (1290 Agilent) coupled to a quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (6550 Agilent Technologies) operated in positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) mode. Metabolites were separated using either C18-RP (ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 1.8 µm, Waters) or HILIC (ACQUITY UPLC BEH 1.7 µm, Waters) chromatography at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The solvent system in C18-RP was A=0.1% formic in water, and B=0.1% formic in acetonitrile. The linear gradient elution started at 100% A (time 0-3 min) and finished at 100% B (20–21 min). The solvent system in HILIC was A=50mM NH4OAc in water, and B=ACN. The linear gradient elution started at 95% B (time 0–2 min) and finished at 55% B (6 min). "	"The injection volume was 2 µl. ESI conditions were gas temperature, 225 °C; drying gas, 13 l/min; nebulizer, 20 psig; fragmentor, 125 V; and skimmer, 65 V. The instrument was set to acquire over the m/z range 80-1200 with an acquisition rate of 4 spectra/s. Quality control samples (QC) consisting of pooled serum samples of all patients were used. QC samples were injected before the first study sample and then periodically after five-study samples. Furthermore, real samples were randomized to reduce systematic error associated with instrumental drift. MS/MS was performed in targeted mode, and the instrument was set to acquire over the m/z range 50-1000, with a default iso width (the width half-maximum of the quadrupole mass bandpass used during MS/MS precursor isolation) of 4 m/z. The collision energy was fixed at 20 V. With the exception of glutamyl taurine and glutamyl glycine, all metabolites were identified conforming to Level 1 as specified by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative[1], that is, by comparison with accurate mass, retention time and MS/MS data of chemical standards analysed in our laboratory with the same analytical platform and method. Glutamyl taurine and glutamyl glycine conform Level 2 (i.e., putatively annotated compound) since we did not find the chemical standards. Still, their experimental MS/MS spectra coincide with the expected fragmentation pattern of these dipeptides.

Targeted metabolomics:</br>
Relevant metabolites were measured again using an UHPLC system (1290 Agilent) coupled to a triple quadrupole (QqQ) MS (6490 Agilent Technologies) operated in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) mode. MRM transitions were: methionine (150->56, 61), methionine sulfoxide (166->56, 74), taurine (126->41, 85), glutamate (148->56, 84), cysteine-glycine (179->59, 116), glutathione (308->76, 162), glutathione disulfide (613->355, 484), glutamate-glutamate (277->84, 130), glutamate-cysteine (251->84, 122), 5-oxoproline (130->56, 84).

PMID:16448051</br>"	"For the NMR data, pure compound references in Bioref AMIX (Bruker), HMDB and Chenomx databases were used for metabolite identification. After baseline correction, intensities of each 1H-NMR regions identified in the CPMG 1D-NMR spectra were integrated for each sample entering the study using the AMIX 3.8 software package (Bruker, GmBH).
</p>
For the MS data, XCMS analysis of these data provided a matrix containing the retention time, m/z value, and integrated peak area of greater than 38.000 features after the analytical variability had been corrected[1]. Only the integrated areas of those metabolite features above 5,000 spectral counts in at least one of the two groups were considered for quantification. The tab-separated text files containing LC-MS data were imported into Rstudio (version 3.0.2) where QC samples were used to filter analytical variation as previously described[1]. Univariate statistical analysis was performed using robust statistics (Yuen-Welch’s t-test). Differentially regulated metabolites (fold>1.5) that passed our statistical criteria (p-value<0.01) were characterized by LC-qTOF MS/MS and identified using the Metlin database and pure standards purchased on our lab. Regression models and multivariate data analysis were performed using Rstudio software version 3.0.2.
