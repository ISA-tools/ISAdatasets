Study Title	"Gluconeogenesis using glycerol as a substrate in bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei"
Study Description	"Bloodstream form African trypanosomes are thought to rely exclusively upon glycolysis for ATP production. Indeed, the pathway has long been considered a potential therapeutic target to tackle the devastating and neglected tropical diseases caused by these parasites. However, plasma membrane glucose and glycerol transporters are both expressed by trypanosomes and these parasites can infiltrate tissues that contain glycerol.</br> Here, we show that trypanosomes can use glycerol for gluconeogenesis, particularly when deprived of glucose. We demonstrate that Trypanosoma brucei hexose transporters 1 and 2 (THT1 and THT2) are localized to the plasma membrane and that knock down of THT1 expression leads to a growth defect that is more severe when THT2 is also knocked down. These data are consistent with THT1 and THT2 being the primary routes of glucose supply for the production of ATP by glycolysis. However, supplementation of the growth medium with glycerol substantially rescued the growth defect caused by THT1 and THT2 knock down. Metabolomic analyses with heavy-isotope labelled glycerol demonstrated that trypanosomes take up glycerol and use it to synthesize intermediates of gluconeogenesis, including fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and hexose 6-phosphates, which feed the pentose phosphate pathway and surface glycoprotein biosynthesis. We also observed increased flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the succinate shunt. We also detected gluconeogenesis-specific fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity, even in wild-type cells grown in the presence of glucose. Thus, contrary to prior thinking, gluconeogenesis can operate in bloodstream form T. brucei. This pathway, using glycerol as a physiological substrate, may be required in mammalian host tissues."

Study Protocol Description	"THT1/THT2 knockdown cells were grown in the presence of tetracycline and 5 mM 13C3-U-glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich) three days prior to sample preparation. Briefly, 5 x 10^7 cells / 200 µl sample aliquot were rapidly cooled in a dry ice/ethanol bath to 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 1300 x g at 4 °C for 10 min and washed with 1 x PBS.</br></br>

The samples were run alongside 170 authentic standards."	"Cells were resuspended in extraction solvent (chloroform:methanol:water, 1:3:1 volume ratio). Following shaking for 1 h at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged at 16,000 x g at 4°C for 10 min and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C until the analysis."	"Samples were separated with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC system (Thermo) using ZIC-pHILIC (150 x 4.6 mm; Merck) column. A 10 µl injection volume was used with a flow rate of 300 µl/min."	"Mass detection was performed by on an Orbitrap Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) at Glasgow Polyomics. Analysis was operated in polarity alternating mode.
"	"The data were processed and analyzed using mzMatch software [1] and mzMatchISO [2].</br></br>
