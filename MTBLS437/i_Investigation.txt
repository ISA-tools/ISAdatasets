Study Title	"Seed Metabolome Analysis of a Transgenic Rice Line Expressing Cholera Toxin B-subunit"
Study Description	"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a candidate crop for production of plant-based vaccines by genetic engineering technologies. MucoRice-CTB has been developed as a rice-seed-based vaccine against cholera by transgenic expression of modified cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) under the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression of endogenous seed storage proteins. Here, we performed non-targeted metabolomic profiling of MucoRice-CTB to understand the overall effects of the genetic engineering on rice seed metabolism using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry."

Study Protocol Description	"In this study, we used two transgenic rice lines (abbreviated as MR-CTB51A and MR-RNAi) and their parental non-transgenic rice cultivar (O. sativa L. cv. Nipponbare; abbreviated as NPB). MR-CTB51A is a transgenic rice line expressing modified CTB and RNA interference (RNAi)-triggers for endogenous seed storage protein genes (MucoRice-CTB transgenic rice line 51A [1]). MR-RNAi is a transgenic rice line expressing RNAi-triggers for endogenous seed storage protein genes (MucoRice-RNAi [2]).
</p>
In both MR-CTB51A and MR-RNAi, the RNAi-triggers for endogenous seed storage protein genes were designed to suppress both prolamin and glutelin gene expression [1,2]. However, the RNAi-trigger sequences and its promoter differed between the two transgenic rice lines [1,2]. In MR-CTB51A, the trigger sequences were 13 kDa prolamin clone RM1 (Os07g0206500) coding sequence (CDS) positions 1–45 and GluB1 (Os02g0249800) CDS positions 139–366 (controlled by 10 kDa prolamin promoter) [1]. In MR-RNAi, the trigger sequences were 13 kDa prolamin clone RM1 (Os07g0206500) CDS positions 1–45 and GluA2 (Os10g0400200) CDS positions 142–270 (controlled by ubiquitin promoter) [2]. MR-CTB51A is a selection marker-free transgenic rice line generated by an agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation method [1]. In contrast, MR-RNAi is a transgenic rice line harbouring a selection marker gene, hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT), under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter [2].
</p>
MR-CTB51A and NPB plants were hydroponically grown in a growth chamber (for details see Kashima et al. [3]). Brown rice samples from NPB plants grown hydroponically were named NPB-HP. NPB plants were also grown in an open-air paddy field (Niigata, Japan) using a conventional method. A brown rice sample from the NPB plants grown in the paddy field was named NPB-PF. MR-RNAi plants were grown in a soil pot in a growth chamber (for details see Kurokawa et al. [2]).
</p>
Rice ears were harvested from MR-CTB51A, MR-RNAi, and NPB plants at least 40 days after heading. After harvesting, the ears were dried in a ventilated incubator for several days until the water content dropped to approximately 10%. From the dried rice ears, rice grains were collected. The husks of the grains were removed to obtain brown rice. Brown rice samples from MR-CTB51A, NPB-HP, and NPB-PF were stored at 4 °C for up to 1–2 weeks. MR-RNAi was stored at room temperature for 4 years. Brown rice samples were powdered and stored at -80 °C until use.

The suspension was shaken for 2 min at a frequency of 30 Hz in a mixer mill (Retsch MM400; Verder Scientific, Haan, Germany). After centrifugation (12,000 x g, 10 min), the supernatant was collected into a new 2-ml tube (Eppendorf), and the precipitate was re-extracted using the same procedure. The supernatants obtained after the first and second extractions were combined and mixed (vortex mixer). The supernatant (800 µl) was transferred to a new 2-ml tube (Eppendorf), and 500 µl of ultrapure water and 400 µl of chloroform were added to the tube and mixed (vortex mixer). After centrifugation (12,000 x g, 2 min), the upper phase (polar fraction) was separated from the lower phase and the inter-phase (non-polar fraction); fractions were lyophilized in 2-ml tubes (Eppendorf) in a centrifugal concentrator (CC-105; Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) for 6 h (polar fraction) or 1 h (non-polar fraction).
</p>
Transesterification of esterified fatty acids was performed using a base-catalyzed method [1]. Sodium methoxide (500 µl, approximately 30% in methanol; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was added to the dried non-polar fraction and incubated at 55 °C for 90 min with shaking (1000 rpm; Thermomixer Comfort, Eppendorf). Then, 1% acetic acid (1 ml) and chloroform (400 µl) were added to the tube and mixed (vortex mixer). After centrifugation (12,000 x g, 2 min), the upper phase was discarded, and ultrapure (1 ml) water was added to the tube. After centrifugation (12,000 x g, 2 min), the upper phase was discarded, and the remaining lower phase was lyophilized in the same centrifugal concentrator for 1 h.
</p>
Metabolites were derivatized using a combination of methoxamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA; Sigma-Aldrich). Methoxamine hydrochloride solution (20 µl; 40 mg/ml in pyridine) was added to the dried polar and non-polar fractions and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min with shaking (1,000 rpm; Thermomixer Comfort). Then, 80 µl of MSTFA was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking as above. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 3 min, the supernatant was filtered through a hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene membrane filter unit (Millex-LG; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and a 1-µl aliquot was used in the GC/TOF-MS analysis.

MassLynx 4.0 software (Waters) was used to control the system. Separation was performed on an HP-5ms column (length, 30 m; inner diameter, 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies). Injection port temperature was set at 230 °C. The GC temperature program was as follows: hold at 70 °C for 1 min followed by a 1 °C/min increase to 76 °C and then a 6 °C/min increase to 350 °C, with a final hold time of 3 min. The carrier gas flow (helium, >99.999% purity; Taiyo Nippon Sanso, Tokyo, Japan) was maintained at 1.0 ml/min. The transfer line temperature was set at 250 °C."	"A Micromass GCT Premier Mass Spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, United States) was used. MassLynx 4.0 software (Waters) was used to control the system. Mass spectra were acquired at 10 spectra/s with a mass range of 50–650 m/z. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization mode. All electron ionization spectra were collected using a detector voltage of 2700 V, electron energy of 70 eV, trap current of 50 μA, filament current of 3.6 A, emission current of 100 μA, and ion source temperature of 250 °C."	"Raw data were processed by MetAlign version 041012 [1] (for automated baseline correction and alignment of all extracted mass peaks across all samples) and AIoutput2 version 1.30 [2] (peak deconvolution, conversion of retention time to retention index values, and peak annotation).
</p>
The parameter values of the MetAlign step were as follows: Part A: Peak slope factor (x noise) = 4, Peak threshold factor (x noise) = 8, Peak threshold (abs. value) = 500, Average peak width at half height (scans) = 4. Part B: Scaling option, No scaling; Internal peak search criteria, Beginning of 1st region = 0 (Max. shift = 5), End of 1st region = 3500 (Max. shift = 5); Tuning alignment option and criteria, Pre-align processing (iterative); Calculation criteria for chromatography shift profiles, Maximum shift per 100 scans = 35, Min. factor (x noise) at 1st and last iteration = 7 and 7, Min. Nr. of masses at 1st and last iteration = 10 and 5. The processed data were exported and imported into AIoutput2 version 1.30 [2].
</p>
The parameter values of the AIoutput2 step were as follows: Height threshold = 500; RT bining = 1; Available index, Retention index; Analysis type, Non targeted; RI tolerance = 20; Match threshold (Identification score) = 0.600; Filtering, Accurate; Height filter = 3,000; RSD (CV) filter = 30. The peaks obtained after the filtering processes are designated as metabolite-candidate peaks. Peak intensity ratios of a metabolite-candidate peak and an internal standard compound (ribitol or testosterone) in the same TIC chromatogram were used to compare metabolite levels among different samples.

Metabolite-candidate peaks were identified based on a Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) considering retention time and weighted mass spectrum between each metabolite-candidate peak and the compounds in our reference library. Out of the 351 metabolite-candidate peaks (198 metabolite-candidate peaks from the non-polar fraction and 153 metabolite-candidate peaks from the polar fraction), 212 were found to match (annotated peaks; identification score =0.600) the compounds stored in our reference library, and 139 did not match (unannotated peaks; identification score <0.600). These annotated peaks are shown with the library top hit compound name with the values of identification score given through the AIoutput2 peak identification processes.
