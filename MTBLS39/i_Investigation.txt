Study Title	"The plasticity of the grapevine berry transcriptome"
Study Description	"Vitis vinifera cultivar Corvina clone 48 berries were harvested from different vineyards, each located in one of the three most important wine production macro-areas of the Verona region: Bardolino, Valpolicella and Soave, on the basis of the site geographical coordinates. For each of the selected vineyards, specific environmental conditions (altitude and type of soil) and farming and agricultural practices used (training system, rows facing direction, planting layout, vineyard age and rootstock type) were recorded. Vineyards were selected in order to maximize differences in locations and in microenvironmental and farming conditions. Berries were harvested at three different developmental stages: véraison, mid-ripening and harvest; each sample was collected in three biological replicates, to cover the whole vineyard variability. The same sampling procedure had been repeated over three consecutive vintages (2006, 2007 and 2008)."

Study Protocol Description	"Vitis vinifera cv Corvina clone 48 berries were harvested from 3 different vineyards near Verona, Italy. We harvested 30 clusters from different positions along two vine rows and from random heights and locations on the plant to ensure the entire vineyard was represented. Samples of berries were harvested at harvesting time within one day in all 3 vineyards we investigated. Three berries were randomly selected from each cluster, avoiding those with visible damage and/or signs of pathogen infection. The berries were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. The °Brix of the must was determined using a digital DBR35 refractometer (Giorgio Bormac, Italy)."	"The same powdered samples used for RNA extraction were extracted in three volumes (w/v) of methanol acidified with 0.1% of formic acid (v/v) in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature and 40 kHz for 15 min."	"HPLC was carried out using a Beckman Coulter Gold 127 HPLC system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) equipped with a System Gold 508 Beckman Coulter autosampler (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Metabolites were separated on an analytical Alltima HP RP-C18 column (150 x 2.1 mm, particle size 3 µm) equipped with a C18 guard column (7.5 x 2.1 mm) both purchased from Alltech (Alltech Associates Inc, Derfield, IL, USA). Two solvents were used: solvent A (5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 5% (v/v) formic acid in water), and solvent B (100% acetonitrile). The linear gradient, at a constant flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, was established from 0 to 10% B in 5 min, from 10 to 20% B in 20 min, from 20 to 25% B in 5 min, and from 25 to 70% B in 15 min. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate, with a 30 µl injection volume and 20 min re-equilibration between each analysis."	"Mass spectra were acquired using a Bruker ion mass spectrometer Esquire 6000 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Alternate negative and positive ion spectra were recorded in the range 50–1500 m/z (full scan mode, 13,000 m/z /s). For metabolite identification, MS/MS and MS3 spectra were recorded in negative or positive mode in the range 50–1500 m/z with a fragmentation amplitude of 1 V. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizing gas (50 psi, 350 °C) and drying gas (10 l/min). Helium was used as the collision gas. The vacuum pressure was 1.4 x 10^-5 mbar. Additional parameters were: capillary source + 4000 V; end plate offset -500 V; skimmer -40 V; cap exit – 121 V; Oct 1 DC -12 V; Oct 2 DC -1.70 V; lens 1 5 V; lens 2 60 V; ICC for positive ionization mode 20000; ICC for negative ionization mode 7000."	"MS data were collected using the Bruker Daltonics Esquire 5.2-Esquire Control 5.2 software, and processed using the Bruker Daltonics Esquire 5.2-Data Analysis 3.2 software (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany)."	"Metabolites were identified by comparison of m/z values, fragmentation patterns (MS/MS and MS³) and retention times of each signal with those of available commercial standards and by comparison of data previously published by our group."
