Study Title	"Post-mortem changes in the metabolomic compositions of rabbit blood, aqueous and vitreous humors"
Study Description	"Introduction: The analysis of post-mortem metabolomic changes in biological fluids opens the way to develop new methods for the estimation of post-mortem interval (PMI). It may also help in the analysis of disease-induced metabolomic changes in human tissues when the postoperational samples are compared to the post-mortem samples from healthy donors. Objectives: The goals of this study are to observe and classify the post-mortem changes occurring in the rabbit blood, aqueous and vitreous humors (AH and VH), to identify the potential PMI markers among a wide range of metabolites, and also to determine which biological fluid – blood, AH or VH – is more suitable for the PMI estimation. Methods: The quantitative metabolomic profiling of samples of the rabbit serum, AH and VH taken at different PMIs has been performed with the combined use of high-frequency NMR and high-resolution LC-MS methods. Results: The quantitative levels of 63 metabolites in the rabbit serum, AH and VH at different PMIs have been measured. It has been found that the post-mortem metabolomic changes in AH and VH proceed slower than in blood, and the data scattering is lower. Among the metabolites whose concentrations increase with time, the most significant and linear growth is found for hypoxanthine, choline and glycerol. Conclusion: The obtained results indicate the advantage of ocular fluids, AH and VH, over blood serum for the search of potential biochemical markers for the PMI estimation. Among the compounds studied in the present work, hypoxanthine, choline and glycerol give the biggest promise as the potential PMI biomarkers."

Study Protocol Description	"Experiments were carried out with 4 domestic rabbits of the same age (approximately 3-month-old) obtained from the vivarium of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics SB RAS. The animals were treated according to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the European Union Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, with the ethics clearance from the International Tomography Center SB RAS. Animals were sacrificed by electrical stunning. The bodies of 3 rabbits were kept at room temperature (24-25 °C) for 31 hr.
</p>
The ante-mortem blood samples were obtained right before the rabbit culling by venepuncture from the marginal ear vein. The post-mortem samples of aqueous humor (AH), vitreous humor (VH) and blood were collected immediately after death (5-10 min post-mortem) and 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, and 23 hr thereafter. 1 more blood sample from each animal was taken 31 hr post-mortem. The post-mortem blood samples (volume 0.4-1.0 ml) were taken by the direct cardiopuncture using the syringe with the thick needle (22G); the samples of AH (0.05-0.12 ml) were taken from the anterior chamber by the cornea puncture with the thin needle (27G), and the samples of VH (0.09-0.12 ml) – by the sclera puncture (in the ora serrata area) with the thick needle (18G). The first 4 samples of AH and VH (10 min, 1, 2, and 4 hr) were taken from 1 eye of each animal, and the second 4 samples – from the other. The collected blood samples were immediately centrifuged (3,000 x g, 10 min), and the plasma obtained was transferred into separate vials. The fluid samples (plasma, AH, VH) were immediately frozen and stored at -70 °C."	"To obtain the protein-free extracts of AH, VH and plasma, 4 volumes of 100% EtOH were added to 1 volume of thawed AH, VH and plasma samples. The mixture was placed in a shaker for 20 min, and then centrifuged (12,000 x g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatants were collected.
</p>
To remove lipids from the plasma and VH extracts, 300 µl CHCl3 was added to 600 µl of the protein-free extract, the sample was shaken for 10 min. Then 300 µl H2O was added, the sample was shaken for 20 min, and left at -20 °C for 30 min. Then the sample was centrifuged (12,000 x g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the aqueous (upper) fraction was collected. The procedure was repeated 1 more time. The obtained protein-free and lipid-free extract was divided into 2 parts in the ratio 2:1, the larger part was used for NMR measurements, and the lesser part – for LC-MS measurements. The AH protein-free extracts were analyzed without the delipidation procedure."	"The extracts for NMR measurements were lyophilized, re-dissolved in 500 µl of D2O containing 6 x 10^-6 M sodium 3-trimethylsilylpropane-1-sulfonate (DSS) as an internal standard and 20 mM deuterated phosphate buffer to maintain pH 7.4."	"All NMR measurements were carried out with the use of a NMR spectrometer AVANCE III HD 700 MHz (Bruker BioSpin, Germany) equipped with a 16.44 Tesla Ascend cryomagnet."	"The proton NMR spectra for each sample were obtained with 200 accumulations. Temperature of the sample during the data acquisition was kept at 25 ºC, the detection pulse was 90º. The repetition time between scans was 30 s to allow for the complete relaxation of all spins. Low power radiation at the water resonance frequency was applied prior to acquisition to presaturate the water signal."	"The baseline processing and integration were done using the ACD/NMR Processor Academic Edition."	"The signal assignment was confirmed either by the addition of standard samples into extract solutions or by the online spectra databases. The concentrations of metabolites in the samples were determined by the peak area integration respectively to the internal standard DSS."
