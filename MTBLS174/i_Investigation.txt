Study Title	"Multi-omic profiles of human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease tissue highlight heterogenic phenotypes"
Study Description	"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a consequence of sedentary life style and high fat diets with an estimated prevalence of about 30% in western countries. It is associated with insulin resistance, obesity, glucose intolerance and drug toxicity. Additionally, polymorphisms in, e.g. APOC3, PNPLA3, NCAN and PPP1R3B, correlate with NAFLD. Several studies have already investigated later stages of the disease. This study characterizes and stratifies distinct grades of the early steatosis stages of the disease with the aim of identifying mechanisms underlying the etiology of the disease. We analyzed liver biopsies and serum samples from patients with distinct grades of steatosis (also pre-disease states) employing transcriptomics, serum biomarkers, metabolomics, and proteomics. We unveiled distinct transcriptome, proteome and metabolome profiles in patients with high-grade and low-grade steatosis. In line with previously reported causes of steatosis and insulin resistance our observed expression differences in the levels of cytokines, in the IGF-axis, in fat metabolism and branched chain amino acids provide a comprehensive image of the deregulated biological system underlying the disease."

Study Protocol Description	"Serum samples were collected from 18 patients with morbid obesity who admitted into hospital for treatment by bariatric surgery (gastric banding, gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy). All patients were recruited in the Multidisciplinary Obesity Research (MORE) project at the Medical University of Graz, Austria or at the Interdisciplinary Adipositas Center at the Kantonsspital St. Gallen, Switzerland. "	"Not applicable."	"Frozen samples were thawed at room temperature and shaken before use. A total 300 μL of a sodium phosphate buffer (70 mM Na2HPO4; 20% (v/v) D2O; 6.15
mM NaN3; 6.64 mM TMSP; pH 7.4) was added to 300 µl of each sample. A total of 450 µl of this mixture was transferred into a 4.25 mm NMR tubes (Bruker BioSpin) for analysis."	"The spectra of human serum samples were acquired on a Bruker spectrometer operating at 14.1 T (600.13 MHz proton Larmor frequency) equipped with a CPTPI cryoprobe, and an automatic tuning-matching unit and an automatic sample changer and temperature 313.4 K."	"A 1D CPMG pulse sequence was used to analyze the serum samples. For each sample 64 transients were collected."	"For each spectrum, the region between 5.0 and 4.5 ppm, which contains the residual water signal, was removed from the subsequent analysis. Taking into account the fact that plasma samples were collected using two different anti-coagulant treated tubes (citrate or EDTA), in further analysis regions with signals that belong to citrate and EDTA complexes were removed. In total five singlets and two multiplets were eliminated.  CPMG 1D spectrum in the range between 0.2 and 10.0 ppm was segmented into 0.02-ppm chemical shift buckets, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using AMIX software (Version 3.8.4; Bruker BioSpin) giving a total of 466 variables. Bucketing is a means to reduce the number of total variables and to compensate for small shifts in the signals.  The spectra were normalized by probabilistic quotient method."	"All resonances of interest were manually checked, and signals were assigned on template one-dimensional NMR profiles by using matching routines of AMIX 7.3.2 (Bruker BioSpin) in combination with the BBIOREFCODE Version 2-0-0 reference database and published literature when available. Additional confirmation were done using data provided in our lab –data base containing spectra of standard  pure compounds. To assess which metabolites (i.e. NMR peaks) were significantly different between different sets a univariate paired Wilcoxon test was used. A P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant."
