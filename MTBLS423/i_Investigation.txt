Study Title	"Untargeted metabolomics identifies a plasma sphingolipid-related signature associated with lifestyle intervention in prepubertal children with obesity"
Study Description	"OBJECTIVE: Childhood obesity is a strong risk factor for adult obesity and metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Early lifestyle intervention in children with obesity reduces future disease risk. The objective of this study is to identify metabolic signatures associated with lifestyle intervention in prepubertal children with obesity.</br>METHODS: Thirty-five prepubertal children (7-10 years) with obesity (BMI>2 standard deviations) were enrolled in the study and participated in a 6-month-long lifestyle intervention program. Physiological and biochemical data and blood samples were collected both at baseline and after the intervention. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach was applied to obtain a comprehensive profiling of plasma samples, identifying 2581 distinct metabolite. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to consolidate all features into 8 principal components. Associations between metabolites and physiological and biochemical variables were investigated.</br>RESULTS: The intervention program significantly decreased mean (95% CI) BMI standard deviation score from 3.56 (3.29-3.84) to 3.11 (2.88-3.34) (P<0.001). PCA identified one component (PC1) significantly altered by the intervention (Bonferroni adjusted P=0.008). A sphingolipid metabolism-related signature was identified as the major contributor to PC1. Sphingolipid metabolites were decreased by the intervention, and included multiple sphingomyelin, ceramide, glycosylsphingosine, and sulfatide species. Changes in several sphingolipid metabolites were associated with intervention-induced improvements in HbA1c levels.</br>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased circulating sphingolipid-related metabolites were associated with lifestyle intervention in prepubertal children with obesity, and correlated to improvements in HbA1c."

Study Protocol Description	"Subjects were recruited at the Obesity Unit by the pediatric endocrine physician. At the first visit, parents Signed the informed consent and all relevant clinical and anthropometric data was obtained. Blood sampling and first interview with the nutritionist (with at Least one of the parents present) was performed within the next 10 days (baseline time point).
</p>
Subjects had follow-up interviews with the nutritionist 2 weeks and 3 months after the initial interview, to review changes made and set new goals. The 6 month visit, which included blood sampling, was scheduled with the pediatric endocrinologist who gave feed-back to the family on clinical outcomes (6 month time point). Finally, participants came to a followup visit 1 year after the end of the intervention program (18 month time point) when anthropometric data was collected."	"Serum aliquots (25 µl) were thawed at 4 °C. Samples were briefly vortex-mixed and proteins were then precipitated by the addition of 475 µl cold methanol/water (8:1 vol/vol) followed by 3 min of ultrasonication and 10 s of vortex-mixing. Aliquots were subsequently maintained on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation for 10 min (19.000 x g, 4 °C), 100 µl of supernatant were transferred to a LC autosampler vial. 

"	"Samples were injected in a UHPLC system (1290 Agilent) coupled to a quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (6550 Agilent Technologies) operated in positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) mode. Metabolites were separated using HILIC (ACQUITY UPLC BEH 1.7 µm, Waters) chromatography at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The solvent system was A=50mM NH4OAc in water, and B=ACN. The linear gradient elution started at 95% B (time 0-2 min) and finished at 55% B (6min). The injection volume was 2 µl."	"The QTOF mass spectrometer (6550 Agilent Technologies) ESI conditions were gas temperature, 225 °C; drying gas, 13 l/min; nebulizer, 20 psig; fragmentor, 125V; and skimmer, 65V. The instrument was set to acquire over the m/z range 80-1200 with an acquisition rate of 4 spectra/s."	"Data tranformation was performed using Proteowizard."	"Metabolite identification was performed using HMDB."
