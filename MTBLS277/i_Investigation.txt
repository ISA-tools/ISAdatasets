Study Identifier	"MTBLS277"
Study Title	"Multi-omics toxicity profiling of engineered nanomaterials"
Study Description	"This study aims to implement methods for toxicological profiling of engineered nanomaterials using toxicogenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics along with computational analyses. For all three omics layers the human cell lines A549 (lung epithelial cells) and THP1 (monocytes) were separately exposed to the nanomaterials TiO2 NM104, MWNCT NM401, and Ag NM300k. Proteomics and metabolomics samples have been performed as biological triplicates and were taken after 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. To assess ecotoxic effects C. elegans worms were grown in soil treated with NM300k. Ecotox samples were taken only at 0 and 24 hours. Integrating all three omics layers will enable the identification of (novel) ENM specific modes of action (MoA). Corresponding proteomics data is available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002401"

Study Protocol Description	"Dispersion of nanomaterials (NM104, NM300K and NM401) have been prepared by dilution in water containing 0.05% of BSA and bath sonication[1]. PMA-differentiated, macrophage-like THP-1 and A549 cells have been exposed to a concentration of 25 µg/ml of nanomaterials at different time points, at 37 °C in RPMI-1640 culture medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 5 ml of 100 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco). THP-1 cells have been cultured with 50 ng/ml of PMA during 72 h for their differentiation prior exposure to the nanomaterials. 3 biological replicates have been prepared for each sample.

Prior to analysis, the samples were thawn, diluted 1:5 with MilliQ water containing Nitrotyrosine (10 µM) as internal standard. Additionally, a pool sample was prepared by blending 20 µl of each available sample followed by 1:5 dilution with MilliQ water also containing 10 µM Nitrotyrosine (Sigma–Aldrich). This pool sample was used as a quality control (QC)."	"An Accela II HPLC system (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany) was hyphenated to an ExactiveTM Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a heated-electrospray ion source operating in the positive and negative ion mode. RPLC-MS measurements were performed with a Hypersil Gold aQ column (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) 100 mm x 2 mm i.d., 1.9 µm particle size. As mobile phases 0.1% formic acid (Sigma–Aldrich) in H2O (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) were used. The flow rate was 300 µl/min and gradient elution was carried out as follows: 100% A for 1.5 min followed by a linear gradient to 100% B in 6.5 min and holding for 2 min. In the end a re-equilibration step was performed for 2 min at 0% B. The total run time was 13 min."	"The MS parameters were tuned for each method and polarity separately with selected metabolites according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For each polarity measurements were carried out in 2 mass ranges, namely m/z 50-250 and m/z 250-1000, which were performed in alternating fashion during each run. The injection order was randomized and a pool sample was measured as every ninth injection."	"The first step of data processing was the peak detection followed by the alignment of signals; this was done in SIEVE (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) as well as in OpenMS (open source software). As a normalization method TIC normalization was chosen. The subsequent data clean-up was performed in R (open source software). "	"Metabolite identification information was not submitted."
