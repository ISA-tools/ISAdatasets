Study Title	"Fission yeast ceramide ts mutants cwh43 exhibit defects in G0 quiescence, nutrient metabolism, and lipid homeostasis (Metabolome assay)"
Study Description	"Cellular nutrient states control whether cells proliferate, or whether they enter or exit quiescence. Here, we report characterizations of fission yeast temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of the evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein, Cwh43, and explore its relevance to utilization of glucose, nitrogen-source, and lipids. GFP-tagged Cwh43 localizes at ER associated with the nuclear envelope and the plasma membrane, as in budding yeast. We found that cwh43 mutants failed to divide in low glucose and lost viability during quiescence under nitrogen starvation. In cwh43 mutant, comprehensive metabolome analysis demonstrated dramatic changes in marker metabolites that altered under low glucose and/or nitrogen starvation, although cwh43 apparently consumed glucose in the culture media. Furthermore, we found that cwh43 mutant had elevated levels of triacylglycerols (TGs) and coenzyme A, and that it accumulated lipid droplets. Notably, TG biosynthesis was required to maintain cell division in cwh43 mutant. Thus, Cwh43 affects utilization of glucose and nitrogen-sources, as well as storage lipid metabolism. These results may fit to a notion developed in budding yeast that Cwh43 conjugates ceramide to GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchored proteins and maintains integrity of membrane organization. </br></br> Metabolome assay data is reported in the current study MTBLS577. </br> Lipidome assay data associated to this study is reported in MTBLS578. </br><br/> Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS578' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS578</span></a>"

Study Protocol Description	"Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains used in this study were derived from haploid wild-type strains 972 (h-) and 975 (h+). A collection of temperature-sensitive (ts) strains made by random mutagenesis was used as has been previously described[1].
</p>
Cultured cells (40 ml per sample, 5 x 10^6 cell/ml) were harvested by vacuum filtration using an Omnipore membrane filter (Millipore, 47 mm diameter and 1 μm pore size). The filter was immediately dropped into a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 25 ml methanol previously chilled to −40 °C. Tubes were kept at −40 °C for approximately 3 min, mixed with a vortexer for 10 s and the filter was removed using forceps. Cells were collected by 3000 rpm centrifugation at −20 °C for 3 min and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was re-suspended in 1 ml 50% methanol (−40 °C) and 10 μl of 1 mM PIPES + HEPES mixture was added as an internal standard.

Proteins were removed by filtration with an Amicon Ultra 10-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore, Billerica, USA). Samples were then concentrated by vacuum evaporation and resuspended in 40 μl of 50% acetonitrile. 1 μl of the sample was used for each LC-MS injection."	"LC-MS data were acquired using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) as described previously[1]. Briefly, for metabolome analysis, LC separation was performed on a ZIC-pHILIC column (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 μm particle size, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Acetonitrile (A) and 10 mM ammonium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) (B) were used as the mobile phase, with gradient elution from 80% (A) to 20% (A) in 30 min, at a flow rate of 100 μl/min.

PMID:20024080</br>"	"LC-MS data were obtained using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  Each sample was analyzed twice, once in negative and once in positive ionization mode."	"Raw LC-MS data were analyzed using MZmine 2 (version 2.21) software (http://mzmine.sourceforge.net). Peak areas were normalized by a weighted contribution of the internal standards (PIPES and HEPES) using MZmine 2. After performing peak detection, isotopic peaks were removed and peak lists of individual samples were aligned using their corresponding m/z and retention time values."	"Peaks were assigned to metabolites based upon their retention times and m/z values. Compounds were identified using either commercially available standards (STD) or with analysis of MS/MS spectra (MS/MS), if no standard was available (see Table S2 in the paper associated with this study)."
