Investigation Description	"The Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center (MaHPIC) is a transdisciplinary malaria systems biology research program supported by an NIH/NIAID contract (# HHSN272201200031C; see <a href=http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu target=_blank>http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu</a>). The MaHPIC generates many data types (e.g., clinical, hematological, parasitological, metabolomics, functional genomics, lipidomics, proteomics, immune response) and mathematical models, to iteratively test and develop hypotheses related to the complex host-parasite dynamics in the course of malaria in non-human primates (NHPs), and metabolomics data via collaborations with investigators conducting clinical studies in malaria endemic countries, with the overarching goal of better understanding human disease, pathogenesis, and immunity. Curation and maintenance of all data and metadata are the responsibility of the MaHPIC.<br/>To access other publicly available results from this and other MaHPIC Experiments, including clinical results (specifics on drugs administered, diet, and veterinary interventions), and other omics, visit <a href=http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/mahpic.jsp target=_blank>http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/mahpic.jsp</a>.</p>"

Study Title	"MaHPIC Experiment 23: Metabolomics from Macaca mulatta infected with Plasmodium cynomolgi B strain to produce and integrate clinical, hematological, parasitological, and omics measures of acute primary infection and relapses"
Study Description	"MaHPIC Experimental Description: Malaria-naive male rhesus macaques (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>), approximately four years of age, were inoculated intravenously with salivary gland sporozoites produced and isolated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from multiple Anopheles species (<i>An. dirus</i>, <i>An. gambiae</i>, and <i>An. stephensi</i>) and then profiled for clinical, hematological, parasitological, immunological, functional genomic, lipidomic, proteomic, and metabolomic measurements. The experiment was designed for about 100 days, with pre- and post-100 day periods to prepare subjects and administer curative treatments respectively. During the 100-day period subjects experienced periods of patent and sub- patent infection. The anti-malarial drug artemether was subcuratively administered to subjects after the initial peak of infection, if subjects were not able to self-resolve. Blood-stage curative artemether was administered to all subjects following peak infection, and following a period of relapse infection. All peaks were clinically determined for each subject. The anti-malarial drugs primaquine and chloroquine were administered to all subjects at the end of the study for curative treatment of the liver and blood-stage infections, respectively. Capillary blood samples were collected daily for the measurement of CBCs, reticulocytes, and parasitemias. Capillary blood samples were collected every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomic analysis. Venous blood and bone marrow samples were collected at seven time points for functional genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and immunological analyses. Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as 'Experiment 23'. This is an iteration of Experiment 04 with the same parasite-host combination and sampling and treatment adjustments made, and this is the first in a series of experiments that includes subsequent homologous (Experiment 24, <i>P. cynomolgi</i> B strain) and heterologous (Experiment 25, <i>P. cynomolgi</i> strain ceylonensis) challenges of individuals from the Experiment 23 cohort. One subject was not included in subsequent experiments due to persistent behavioral issues that prevented sample collection. This dataset was produced by Dean Jones at Emory University.

</p><br/>
Procedures:<br/>
1. Sample batches; All samples are randomized to prevent batch degradation in one set of samples. Group individual subjects separately and then randomize the samples within the subject group. Example of a batch: Technical triplicates = 20 samples + 2 qstd = 25 hours (6 injections total).</br>
2. Thaw 1 batch of samples per day on ice. 1st batch only – include NIST, Qstd, HILIC, C18, and any other pooled reference; all other batches will only need Qstd and other pooled references. Isotopes (internal standards) will also need to be thawed and spiked in all samples.</br>
3. Make stock solution of Acetonitrile/isotope in Eppendorf tube; Per one sample = 100 µl Acetonitrile + 2.5 µl isotope. Triplicates =  20 samples = 2000 µl Acetonitrile + 50 µl isotope. Plasma sample, Qstd, and NIST are prepared the same way.</br>
4. MaHPIC: 30 µl of samples were aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes, if possible, add water to reach 50µl of total solution. Qstd, and NIST: Pipette 50 µl sample into Eppendorf tube.</br>
5. Pipette 100 µl of ACN:isotope stock solution to Eppendorf tube containing the sample. Keep samples on ice; let ACN crash proteins for 30 mins with a vortex every 15 mins. Centrifuge for 10 minutes @ 13.2rpm at 4 ℃ and carefully pipette the supernatant (~100 µl) into autosampler vial. You will be able to see clear separation (cloudy and clear) → pipette only the clear supernatant.</br>
6. The orbitrap will end up with the hi-lo-lo pattern for each sample triplicate.</br>"	"Samples were analysed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 LC coupled with High Field QExactive. Each sample was run in triplicate with 5-10 µl injection volume on each column. (HFQE switches between polarities without having to wait for 2 hours in between polarity switching.)</br>

apLCMS is a set of algorithms written to work with the statistical R program.  In this set of algorithms, large capacities of LCMS data can be analyzed by realigning the m/z based on certain parameters.  The output of apLCMS includes retention times, m/z features that appeared in the LCMS run, and also the ion intensities of each of these m/z features for every sample. The data will be used for further data analysis.</br>
Files were converted to .cdf using Thermo File Converter and then to apLCMS.
</p>
Quality Assurance:</br>
1. Five standards were chosen and graphed out to view the intensity over the entire set run. The standards provide information and assurance that the plasma samples were acceptable for further analysis.</br>
2. Total Ion intensity was used as a good indicator on whether the batch was interrupted midway or not.  
</p>
Data Analysis and Quality Assurance
1. xMSanalyzer: used for data extraction and quality evaluation (https://sourceforge.net/projects/xmsanalyzer/).</br>
All batches are ran together as a whole with xMSanalyzer (include the cdf, profile, rawprof, etc). The r script will run through multiple parameter settings. xMSanalzyer will merge different parameter settings and discard anything with a CV of higher than 50% and generate sample and quality reports. This information is included in the feature table worksheet.
2. Batch-effect evaluation and correction performed using PCA.</br>
Batch-effect correction is performed using ComBat [1] implemented in the “sva” package in R Bioconductor. PCA plots are generated to verify.</br>

Description of score categories: (Stage 4 of xMSannotator) <br/>
3: High confidence matches that satisfy all criteria (correlated and co-eluting ions that are in the same module and satisfy abundance ratio checks for isotopes and multiple Ms) <br/>
2: Medium confidence match4e: includes chemicals for which all above criteria are satisfied but the ions are not in the same module even though they are correlated. - This category also includes M+H matches that are enriched based on the pathway level information that builds confidence in a match if there are other high scoring matches for chemicals that are in the same KEGG pathway and are also in the same module. <br/>
1: Low confidence match: includes matches where either 2M or 3M adducts are present but no single M adduct is present.<br/>
0: No confidence match: includes matches where ions are correlated and in the same module, but the delta retention time is greater than the maximum threshold; or if the M+1 or M+2 form is present in the absence of M. This category also includes M+H matches that can not be associated with a single m/z."
