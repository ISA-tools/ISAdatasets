STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS278"
Study Title	"Metabolomics dataset of PPAR-pan treated rat liver (eicosanoid assay)"
Study Description	"This article contains mass spectrometry (MS) data investigating small molecule changes as an effect of a triple peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-pan) agonist GW625019 in the liver as described in the manuscript “PPAR-pan Activation Induces Hepatic Oxidative Stress and Lipidomic Remodelling“ [1]. Samples were analysed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to measure intact lipids, carnitines and selected aqueous metabolites and eicosanoids. Data files comprise of Excel (Microsoft, WA, USA) spreadsheets of identified metabolites and there area ratio values for total fatty acids, carnitines, aqueous metabolites, and eicosanoids where the intensity of the analytes were normalised to the intensity of the internal standard. In the case of open profiling intact lipid data, the Excel file contains area ratio values of retention time and mass to charge ratio pairs; again, the area ratio values were calculated by normalising to the intensity of the internal standard. It should be noted that several metabolic changes are potentially indirect (secondary, tertiary and ensuing changes). </p> The protocols and data of eicosanoids are included in current study MTBLS278.</br> The protocols and data of the carnitine and targeted aqueous metabolites are reported in the study MTBLS303. </p> Ref: </br> [1] Zsuzsanna Ament, James A West, Elizabeth Stanley, Tom Ashmore, Lee D Roberts, Jayne Wright, Andrew W Nicholls, Julian L Griffin, PPAR-pan Activation Induces Hepatic Oxidative Stress and Lipidomic Remodelling, Free Radic Biol Med. 2015 Nov 30;95:357-368."

Study Protocol Description	"PPAR-pan activator was administered to male Sprague–Dawley rats (Crl:CD (SD) strain), 12 animals per group, by daily oral gavage at 30, 100, 300, 1000 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks. A separate satellite group of animals (6 per group) were kept for a 4 week treatment free period in the control, intermediate 2 (300 mg/kg/day) and high (1000 mg/kg/day) dose groups. Liver tissue samples were collected following an overdose of anaesthetic (halothane Ph. Eur. Vapour). Samples were immediately removed, weighed, and sections snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Samples were maintained at -80 °C until further analysis."	"Eicosanoids were extracted using solid phase extraction (SPE) Waters Oasis-HLB cartridges (Waters Ltd., Elstree, Hertfordshire, UK). SPE columns were washed with ethyl acetate (2 ml), methanol (2 x 2 ml), and 15% methanol with 0.1% acetic acid (2 ml). Approximately 100 mg liver tissue samples were homogenised on a TissueLyser (Qiagen Ltd., Manchester, UK; 10 min at 30 Hz) in 1.5 ml 15% methanol with 0.1% acetic acid. The samples were centrifuged (17000 x g, 2 min) and the supernatant loaded onto the SPE columns. Cartridges were washed with 1 ml 15% methanol with 0.1% acetic acid. Analytes of interest were eluted with 0.5 ml of methanol followed by 1 ml of ethyl acetate and immediately dried under nitrogen. Samples were finally reconstituted in 40 µl methanol containing 70 nM PGE2-d4 internal standard and transferred to autosampler vials."	"Analysis was performed using a 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (AB Sciex UK Limited, Warrington, Cheshire) coupled to an Acquity ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The autosampler was maintained at 4 °C, LC separation was achieved using a Luna, 3 µm particle size, 150 x 2 mm column (Phenomenex Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK). The gradient of mobile phase A (0.1% acetic acid in water) and B (0.1% acetic acid in acetonitrile:methanol 80:20) is detailed in Supplementary Table 3 in the papers assocaiated with this study. The flow rate was held at 0.4 ml/min."	"Analysis was performed using a 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (AB Sciex UK Limited, Warrington, Cheshire). Metabolites of interest were measured in negative ionisation mode with unscheduled multiple reaction monitoring events (MRMs)."	"Peaks were integrated by the Quantitation Wizard within Analyst™ version 1.6 by AB Sciex Ltd. (Warrington, Cheshire, UK) and normalised against wet tissue weight and to the intensity of the internal standard."	"Identified based on fragmentation patterns of analyte standards and retention times."
