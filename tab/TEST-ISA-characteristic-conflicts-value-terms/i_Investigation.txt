Study Title	Metabolic phenotyping of urine from a dementia research cohort									
Study Description	"To better understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning physiological variation in human populations, metabolic phenotyping approaches are increasingly being applied to studies involving hundreds and thousands of biofluid samples. Hyphenated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) has become a fundamental tool for this purpose. However, the seemingly inevitable need to analyze large studies in multiple analytical batches for UPLC-MS analysis poses a challenge to data quality which has been recognized in the field. Herein, we describe in detail a fit-for-purpose UPLC-MS platform, method set, and sample analysis workflow, capable of sustained analysis on an industrial scale and allowing batch-free operation for large studies. Using complementary reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) together with high resolution orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometry (oaTOF-MS), exceptional measurement precision is exemplified with independent epidemiological sample sets of approximately 650 and 1000 participant samples. Evaluation of molecular reference targets in repeated injections of pooled quality control (QC) samples distributed throughout each experiment demonstrates a mean retention time relative standard deviation (RSD) of <0.3% across all assays in both studies and a mean peak area RSD of <15% in the raw data. To more globally assess the quality of the profiling data, untargeted feature extraction was performed followed by data filtration according to feature intensity response to QC sample dilution. Analysis of the remaining features within the repeated QC sample measurements demonstrated median peak area RSD values of <20% for the RPC assays and <25% for the HILIC assays. These values represent the quality of the raw data, as no normalization or feature-specific intensity correction was applied. While the data in each experiment was acquired in a single continuous batch, instances of minor time-dependent intensity drift were observed, highlighting the utility of data correction techniques despite reducing the dependency on them for generating high quality data. These results demonstrate that the platform and methodology presented herein is fit-for-use in large scale metabolic phenotyping studies, challenging the assertion that such screening is inherently limited by batch effects. Details of the pipeline used to generate high quality raw data and mitigate the need for batch correction are provided."

Study Protocol Description	"<p>The Alzheimer’s disease study consists of a series of serum, plasma and urine biofluid samples collected as part of the AddNeuroMed and ART/DCR study consortia<strong>[1]</strong>, which follow patients longitudinally with the aim of identifying biomarkers of neurocognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. The samples analysed by LC-MS and NMR, and for which data is provided in this MetaboLights study, are baseline spot urine samples (first sample collected after&nbsp;recruitment to the study). Patients were asked to fast for 2 h prior to urine sample collection, and no samples in this set were freeze-thawed before use in this trial.</p><p><br></p><p>The cohort consists of 2 broad groups of subjects. Subjects with <strong>AD </strong>were collected from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Subjects with MCI and unaffected <strong>controls </strong>were ascertained through primary care. In brief, participating GP clinics contacted all registered patients over the age of 70 and patients were invited to attend the practice for an assessment of memory. Screening assessment consisted of information and consent processes and a screening assessment for dementia. Subjects with normal cognition were entered into the study as unaffected controls, patients with impaired cognition or subjective memory impairment then underwent a full assessment consisting of cognition, behaviour and function together with an extensive clinical interview. Subjects meeting Petersen criteria for amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for possible or probable Alzheimer’s disease were classified accordingly. A proportion of subjects have had MRI, and in some cases, serial MRI. All subjects were assessed annually – <strong>controls </strong>by a standardised telephone interview for cognition (TICS-M) and MCI and <strong>AD </strong>groups using a full interview including cognitive assessment. <strong>Control </strong>subjects receive full interview assessment if cognitive score suggests deterioration and possible conversion to MCI. Conversion from MCI to dementia is assessed by cognitive and other deterioration and by review by an experienced clinician. Detailed information about this cohort and clinical metadata can be found in the previous published paper<strong>[1] </strong>and the ANMERGE repository<strong>[2]</strong>, available via the Sage BioNetworks portal (<a href='https://doi.org/10.7303/syn22252881' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://doi.org/10.7303/syn22252881</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Alzheimer’s disease study samples came from the AddNeuroMed and ART/DCR studies with ethical approval from boards in the respective study site institutions across Europe.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample handling and aliquotting</strong></p><p>Urine samples were received on dry ice and immediately stored at -80 °C. Meta-data variables essential to the design of the study were identified and used to determine sample analysis orders that were uncorrelated with those factors using in-house software, avoiding the potential for confounding critical clinical variables with analytical run order effects. For each study, this order was preloaded into an in-house laboratory information management system (LIMS). Samples were then sorted into sets of 80 using aluminium racks (9x9 position format) cooled by direct contact with dry ice to ensure that all samples remained frozen for the duration of the sorting exercise. Completed sets were stored at -80 °C until required for subsequent steps.</p><p><br></p><p>Once sorted, individual urine sample sets were reformatted into 96-well plates. This step required the overnight thawing of a set of 80 samples at 4 °C, mixing of each individual sample by vortexing, and transference of the liquid contents of each sample to a well within a 96-deep-well polypropylene plate (2 mL, Eppendorf). During this process, each sample was checked against a LIMS-generated map of sample identifiers and positions in the 96-well plate to validate the batch composition and sample order. Study samples were added only to the wells within the first 10 columns of rows A through H; columns 11 and 12 of the plate were reserved for the later addition of pooled quality control (<strong>QC</strong>) reference samples. The plate was sealed with a silicone cap mat and centrifuged at 3,486 × g for 10 min at 4 °C using an Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge equipped with an A-2-DWP-AT rotor for the removal of suspended particulate matter such as cryoprecipitate, cellular debris, or crystalline material. The supernatant was aspirated and dispensed in pre-programmed volumes among 96-well polypropylene plates using an 8-channel 15-1200 μL Eppendorf Xplorer Plus pipette with an initial discarding step into an 800 mL beaker to be used as <strong>NMR </strong>Study Reference. The volume dispensed in plates included 600 μL to a 2.0 mL plate (<strong>NMR</strong>), 150 μL to a 0.5 mL plate (reversed-phase chromatography, <strong>RPC</strong>), 50 μL to a 0.5 mL plate (hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, <strong>HILIC</strong>) and 50 μL to a 0.3 mL plate (study reference, <strong>SR</strong>, sample). All plates were sealed with a silicone cap mat and returned to -80 °C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Preparation of Method Reference (MR) and Internal Standards (IS) mixtures</strong></p><p>Mixtures of reference chemicals were generated for both <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC </strong>methods, enabling the targeted assessment of instrument stability (e.g.chromatographic retention, mass accuracy, and signal intensity) and data quality. <strong>IS </strong>are added to all samples in the study and<strong> MR</strong> standards are also added to all <strong>QC </strong>samples. L-phenylalanine13C9, 15N (from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany)) and N-benzoyl-d5-glycine (hippuric acid, from QMX (Essex, U.K.)) were used in both chromatographic assay types as a 2-point IS. The RPC <strong>MR </strong>was composed of 8 reference standards from Sigma-Aldrich and QMX: L-glutamic acid-13C5; L-isoleucine-13C6,15N; L-leucine-13C6, L-tryptophan-13C11,15N2; L-glutamine-13C5; creatinine-(methyl-d3), cytidine-5,6-d2; and benzoic acid-phenyl-13C6. 2 of these standards were determined to not be suitable for analysis of <strong>RPC+</strong> data quality (L-glutamine13C5 and benzoic acid-phenyl13C6), while 1 was not suitable for analysis <strong>RPC-</strong> data (creatinine-(methyl-d3), cytidine-5,6-d2). The <strong>HILIC MR </strong>was composed of 6 reference standards from Sigma-Aldrich, QMX and CDN isotopes (Quebec, Canada): adenosine-2-d1; adenine-2-d1; 2-aminoethane-d4-sulfonic acid(taurine-d4); creatine-(guanidino-13C)monohydrate; L-arginine-13C6; and uracil-2-13C,15N2.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Preparation of Quality Control (QC) samples</strong></p><p>QC samples were analysed at regular intervals throughout the run and utilized to support the assessment of data quality within each experiment for LC-MS and NMR analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Long Term Reference (LTR)</strong></p><p>A pooled <strong>Long Term Reference</strong> (<strong>LTR</strong>) urine sample is maintained by the laboratory and is used as an independent sample reference throughout all molecular profiling studies. To create this material, 78 individual urine voids were collected in a single day from volunteer subjects. No screening criteria were used to assess the health status of the donors. All samples were stored at 4 °C from collection until the following day when all samples were combined and aliquoted by the following procedure. Individual samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 3,214 × g and their supernatants combined in a 20 L polypropylene vessel. The pooled sample was homogenized in the vessel by gentle stirring using a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and magnetic stir plate. Aliquots were created by multiple iterations of dispensing 1 L of pooled urine supernatant to a 1 L glass bottle and aliquoting that material into 15 mL polypropylene conical centrifuge tubes (Corning) using an Eppendorf 5-25 mL Varispenser plus. This process was repeated until all of the reference material was aliquoted. All aliquots were stored at -80 °C until required for further preparation. A sufficient volume of LTR sample (approximately 2 mL per 80 study samples) was thawed for <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC </strong>assays and supplemented with the relevant <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC MR </strong>mixtures in a 2:1 LTR:MR ratio, homogenized, and aliquoted to 1.7 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes. All LTR materials were frozen at -80 °C until required for analytical plate preparation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Study Reference (SR)</strong></p><p>A pooled <strong>Study Reference </strong>(<strong>SR</strong>)<strong> </strong>sample representing the mean of samples within the Alzheimer’s study was prepared. For <strong>NMR </strong>analysis the <strong>SR </strong>was created by pooling a small volume of each sample in the study into an 800 mL beaker during the sampling reformatting step. The beaker was frozen overnight and homogenised at the end of the reformatting process, then subsequently split into 5 mL aliquots and taken back to -80 °C. 2 aliquots of 600 μL were added to each <strong>NMR </strong>plate before analysis. For <strong>LC-MS</strong> analysis, the <strong>SR </strong>was created by thawing the contents of all <strong>SR </strong>sample plates (with 50 μL of each sample) at 4°C and combining their contents in an 800 mL glass beaker. Optionally, individual samples determined to be unsuitable for <strong>UPLC-MS</strong> analysis (by sample pre-screening via <strong>NMR </strong>spectroscopy) were removed from the individual <strong>SR </strong>sample plate wells prior to pooling in order to avoid incorporation of severely contaminated or outlying samples which may compromise the <strong>SR</strong>. The pooled sample was homogenized by swirling and portioned in an approximate 3:1 ratio for use with <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC </strong>assays respectively. The <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC </strong>sub-fractions were supplemented with the relevant <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC MR</strong> mixtures in a 2:1 <strong>SR:MR</strong> ratio, homogenized, and aliquoted to 1.7 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes. All <strong>SR </strong>materials were frozen at -80 °C until required for analytical plate preparation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dilution series</strong></p><p>A dilution series of <strong>SR </strong>samples was prepared for each assay type from thawed <strong>SR </strong>in the same manner described above except that they were prepared in bulk volume in Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes and the products were stored in polypropylene sample vials for analysis supporting multiple injections from the same stock. Prior to and immediately following the analysis of each experiment’s samples, dilution series samples were analysed by repeated measurement aimed at weighting the ends of the series (10,10,5,3,3,5, and 10 consecutive replicate injections of the 1%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% <strong>SR </strong>samples respectively).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Lovestone S, Francis P, Kloszewska I, Mecocci P, Simmons A, Soininen H, Spenger C, Tsolaki M, Vellas B, Wahlund LO, Ward M; AddNeuroMed Consortium.

All study samples were diluted with ultrapure water (75 μL for RPC preparation and 25 μL for HILIC preparation), commensurate with the volume of QC sample dilution caused by the addition of MR. LTR stock and SR stock aliquots were thawed and their contents distributed among the wells of columns 11 and 12, respectively (225 μL for RPC analysis and 75 μL for HILIC analysis). Finally, the IS solution was added to all samples (75 μL for RPC preparation and 25 μL for HILIC preparation). Sample plates for RPC analysis were sealed with a silicone cap mat, mixed for 1 min at 4 °C using a MixMate (Eppendorf) operating at 850 rpm, and centrifuged for 10 min at 3,486 × g. The supernatant was split between 2 analytical microwell plates, 1 for positive and 1 for negative ion mode UPLC-MS analysis. Acetonitrile (ACN) was added to samples for HILIC analysis in a 3:1 ACN:sample ratio to better match the initial solvent conditions of the chromatographic method. The sample plate was then sealed with Thermo-Seal heat sealing foil sheets using an ALPS 50 V-Manual Heat Sealer (Thermo SCIENTIFIC) prior to mixing for 1 minute at 4 °C using a MixMate (Eppendorf) operating at 850 rpm. The plates were subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 3486 × g to remove any residual protein precipitated by this addition of organic solvent, and a 150 μL volume of the supernatant was decanted to a microplate for analysis.

The probe temperature was set to 300 K. Temperature calibration using a standard methanol sample, assessment of spectrometer performance and water suppression, and calibration of the eretic signal for quantitation was performed before the acquisition of each set of samples as described in the previously published paper<strong>[1]</strong>. <strong>TopSpin v. 3.6</strong> (Bruker Coorporation, Germany) was used for acquisition and automatic processing of all spectra.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Dona AC, Jiménez B, Schäfer H, Humpfer E, Spraul M, Lewis MR, Pearce JT, Holmes E, Lindon JC, Nicholson JK.
