Study Protocol Description	ex vivo tissue slice experiment with isotopic labeling.	ex vivo tissue slice experiment with isotopic labeling.	Dionex ICS-5000+ ion chromatograph interfaced to a Thermo Fusion Orbitrap Tribrid mass spectrometer (IC-FTMS). Data were adjusted as follows: 1)Get raw XIC peak areas from TF33 -> 2)correct for protein content by reconstituting the volumes according to tissue wet weight  -> 3) correct for NA abundance. Some compounds were assigned using a sperate standard run, others were assigned because they were the only or the highest peak in the extracted ion chromatogram. (XIC).
