Study Title	"Seasonal variation of secondary metabolites in 9 different moss and liverwort species"
Study Description	"In Eco-Metabolomics, non-model organisms are typically studied in their natural environment and relations are made between biochemistry and ecological function. Current challenges when processing such data involve, among others, complex ecological experiment designs, peak detection parameter settings and high variation of metabolite profiles of different species. Here, we present a representative dataset generated from 108 samples of 9 bryophyte species obtained in four seasons using an untargeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS) acquisition method. With this dataset, we address the challenges in data processing focusing on data import, analytical quality control and peak detection. We expect that this representative dataset will encourage researchers to conduct subsequent Eco-Metabolomics studies."

Study Protocol Description	"Samples of the nine moss species Brachythecium rutabulum (Hedw.) Schimp., Calliergonella cuspidata (Hedw.) Loeske, Fissidens taxifolius Hedw., Grimmia pulvinata (Hedw.) Sm., Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw. (H. lacunosum was not differentiated), Marchantia polymorpha L., Plagiomnium undulatum (Hedw.) T.J. Kop., Polytrichum strictum Menzies ex Brid. and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus (Hedw.) Warnst. were collected at random locations in the area of the Botanical Gardens of the Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg. Sampling was performed in spring (2016/04/13), summer (2016/08/08), autumn (2016/11/09) and winter (2017/01/27) at relatively comparable conditions as it is known that short-term climatic fluctuations and rainfall can influence secondary metabolite content and ammonium uptake of bryophytes [1]. Thus, the bryophytes were only collected when there was sunshine at least two days prior to and during sampling. Furthermore, sampling was performed after mid-day between 13:00 and 15:00. In each season, three composite samples of different individuals of each species were taken, leading to a total of 3 * 9 * 4 = 108 samples. Only above-ground parts of the moss gametophytes such as leaves, branches, stems or thalloid parts were taken for sampling. From dioecious species such as M. polymorpha, P. strictum and P. undulatum female, male and sterile gametophytes were collected in a composite sample. Before sampling, visible archegonial and antheridial heads and any below ground parts such as rhizoids and rooting stems were removed with a sterile tweezer. The gametophytic moss parts were put in Eppendorf tubes and were frozen instantly on dry ice and later in the lab in liquid nitrogen.</br></br> Ref:</br> [1] Cornelissen JH, Lang SI, Soudzilovskaia NA, During HJ.

Samples were vortexed and thawed while shaking for 10 min at 1000 rpm at room temperature followed by ultrasonification for 15 min and again 10 min shaking. After 15 min centrifugation at 13000 rpm, 500 µl of supernatant were dried in a vacuum centrifuge at 40 °C and reconstituted in 80/20 (v/v) methanol/water with the volume adjusted to the initial fresh weight of the sample to a final concentration of 10 mg fresh weight per 100 µl extract."	"Chromatographic separations were performed at 40 °C on an Acquity UPLC system (Waters) equipped with an HSS T3 column (100 × 1 mm, particle size 1.8 µm; Waters) applying the following binary gradient at a flow rate of 150 µl/min: 0 to 1 min, isocratic 95% A (water:formic acid: 99.9:0.1 [v/v]), 5% B (acetonitrile:formic acid: 99.9:0.1 [v/v]); 1 to 18 min, linear from 5% to 95% B; 18 to 20 min, isocratic 95% B. The injection volume was 2.0 µl (full loop injection)."	"UPLC/ESI-QTOF-MS was performed on a MicrOTOF II Q High Resolution hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) as described in Böttcher et al. [1] with the following MS instrument settings: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 1.4 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 6 l/min, 190°C; capillary, 5000 V (+4000 V for neg-mode); end plate offset, -500 V; funnel 1 radio frequency (RF), 200 Volts peak-to-peak (Vpp); funnel 2 RF, 200 Vpp; in-source collision-induced dissociation (CID) energy, 0 eV; hexapole RF, 100 Vpp; quadrupole ion energy, 3 eV (-5 eV for neg-mode); collision gas, nitrogen; collision energy, 7 eV (-7 eV for neg-mode); collision cell RF, 250 Vpp (150 Vpp for neg-mode); transfer time, 70 µs; prepulse storage, 5 µs; pulser frequency, 10 kHz; and spectra rate, 3 Hz. Quality control samples with internal standards were interspersed in addition to the bryophyte samples on the MicrOTOF (Böttcher et al. 2009). Mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode. Calibration of the m/z scale was performed for individual raw data files on lithium formate cluster ions obtained by automatic infusion of 20 µl of 10 mm lithium hydroxide in isopropanol:water:formic acid, 49.9:49.9:0.2 (v/v/v) at the end of the gradient.</br></br>

Plant Cell. 2009 Jun; 21(6): 1830–1845. DOI: 10.1105/tpc.109.066670 "	"Chromatographic peak picking was performed in R 3.4.2 (https://cran.r-project.org) with the package XCMS 1.52.0 [1] using the “centWave” algorithm and the following parameters: ppm=35, peakwidth=4,21, snthresh=10, prefilter=5-50, fitgauss=TRUE, verbose.columns=TRUE. Grouping of chromatographic peaks was performed with two factors (in XCMS called “phenoData”): seasons with the levels “spring”, “summer”, “autumn” and “winter”; and species with the levels “Brarut”, “Calcus”, “Fistax”, “Gripul”, “Hypcup”, “Marpol”, “Plaund”, “Polstr” and “Rhysqu”. The following parameters were used for grouping: mzwid=0.01, minfrac=0.5, bw=4. During manual control, we found that the function “fillPeaks” of XCMS, which imputes missing values of grouped samples in the peak table matrix, does not work well for data with high variation. As a result, we omitted this step in peak alignment. To improve subsequent data analyses, intensities in the peak table were logn transformed before grouping and features were removed that were not between retention times 20 sec and 1020 sec. Retention time correction was performed using the function retcor in XCMS using the parameters method=loess, family=gaussian, missing=10, extra=1, span=2. The parameters were additionally optimized using the R package IPO 1.3.3 [2], but better alignment precision was achieved with manual control and knowledge of instrument settings [3].  Adduct annotation was performed with the R package CAMERA 1.33.3 [4] by using the following functions: xsAnnotate, groupFWHM, findIsotopes, groupCorr, findAdducts; with the following parameters: perfwhm=0.6, ppm=5, mzabs=0.005, calcIso=TRUE, calcCiS=TRUE, calcCaS=TRUE, graphMethod=lpc, pval=0.05, cor_eic_th=0.75. To improve subsequent statistical analyses, instead of the CAMERA function getPeaklist the function getReducedPeaklist was written in order to aggregate the adducts of putative compounds into a feature list with singular components (Data Citation 4). Since version 1.33.3 the function getReducedPeaklist is officially part of CAMERA. For the study, the parameter method=median was chosen.</br></br>
