Study Protocol Description	" 2 methods were used: Precellys homogenization (Precellys_homogenization_SOP-2015-04-09.pdf, measurements: IC-FTMS1) and Retsch homogenization (protocol: Retsch_homogenization_SOP-2015-09-27.pdf, measurements: IC-FTMS2)"	" Preparation of polar samples for GCMS, NMR, and IC-FTMS; Protein extraction and quantification"	" none"	""	" IC-FTMS1: Data were adjusted as follows: 1)Get raw XIC peak areas from TF33 -> 2)correct for protein content by adjusting the signals according by wet weight -> 3) correct for NA abundance. Some compounds were assigned using a sperate standard run, others were assigned because they were the only or the highest peak in the extracted ion chromatogram. (XIC)."	""	"ridiculous"	""
