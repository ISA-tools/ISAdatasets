Study Title	"ATP-binding Cassette Sub-family C Member 5 (ABCC5) Functions as an Efflux Transporter of Glutamate Conjugates and Analogs"
Study Description	"The ubiquitous efflux transporter ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 5 (ABCC5) is present at high levels in the blood-brain barrier, neurons and glia, but its function is not known. Untargeted metabolomic screens revealed that Abcc5-/- mice accumulate endogenous glutamate conjugates in several tissues, but brain in particular. The abundant neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), for example, was over 2-fold higher in Abcc5-/- brain. In line with ABCC5-mediated transport, the metabolites that accumulated in Abcc5-/- tissues were depleted in cultured cells that overexpressed human ABCC5. Using membrane vesicles, we show that ABCC5 not only transports the metabolites detected in our screen, but also a wide range of peptides containing a C-terminal glutamate. Glutamate conjugates are of physiological relevance because they can affect the function of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Interestingly, we found that ABCC5 also transports exogenous glutamate analogs, like the classic excitotoxic neurotoxins kainic acid, domoic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and the therapeutic glutamate analog ZJ43. Taken together, we have identified ABCC5 as a general glutamate conjugate and analog transporter that can affect the disposition of endogenous metabolites, toxins and drugs."

Study Protocol Description	"Abcc5-/- mice on a FVB background and wild-type mice were housed in constant temperature rooms with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle and received food and water ad libitum. Mouse handling and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for animal care and use. Approximately 16 week-old male mice (N=5 per genotype) were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation after which tissues were collected and frozen on dry ice. Whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture and kept on ice until separation of plasma and erythrocytes by centrifugation (10 min, 5,000 x g, 4 °C). The plasma layer was collected, and the buffy coat containing peripheral blood mononuclear cells was discarded from the erythrocyte pellet, which was subsequently washed with 1 ml cold PBS. All samples were stored at -20 °C until further processing."	"Collected tissues were weighed, transferred to 2 ml Eppendorf vials on ice containing 70% methanol and lysed for 10 min at 50 Hz using the TissueLyser LT (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For plasma, erythrocytes and culture medium a volume of 200 µl sample was mixed with 600 µl cold methanol, vortexed and left on ice for 30 minutes.
</p>
After centrifugation (10 min, 20,800 x g, 4 °C) of the extracts and cell lysates, the supernatant was transferred to a second Eppendorf vial and evaporated to dryness in a speedvac at room temperature. The dried extracts were reconstituted in mobile phase A (5 mM N,N-dimethylhexylamine in water:methanol 95:5 (vol:vol) adjusted to pH 7.0) and centrifuged (10 min, 20,800 x g, 4 °C)."	"Liquid chromatography was performed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A volume of 5 µl was injected onto a ReprosilPur Basic C18 HPLC column (150 × 0.5 mm; 2.4-µm particles; Dr. Maisch) protected by a KrudKatcher Ultra in-line filter (Phenomenex) and maintained at 30 °C. Elution was performed using a gradient (0–22 min: 0–53% B; 22–25 min: 53–100% B; 25–35 min: 100% B; 35–50 min: 0% B) of 5 mM N,N-dimethylhexylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) in water:methanol 95:5 (vol:vol) (mobile phase A) and 20:80 (vol:vol) (mobile phase B) adjusted to pH 7.0 with acetic acid, at a flow rate of 15 µl/min."	"Detection was performed with an LTQ-Orbitrap Discovery mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in negative ionization mode, scanning from m/z 50 to 1,500 with a resolution of 30,000 FWHM. Electrospray ionization was performed with the capillary temperature set at 300 °C and the sheath, auxiliary, and sweep gas flow set at 20, 10 and 1 arbitrary units (AU), respectively. Data acquisition was performed using Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific)."	"After conversion of the raw data using MSconvert, global metabolite profiles of wild-type and Abcc5-/- mice were first compared per organ using XCMS. From these data we selected the features that were significantly (p<0.05) higher (>2-fold) in Abcc5-/- mice in at least two tissue-types using metaXCMS."	"The retention time and peak shape of each feature was compared to manually filter out features associated with the same metabolite. The accurate mass of the differentially present compounds was used for searches in the METLIN, HMDB and MassBank databases. Additionally, high-resolution fragmentation spectra were obtained as described. The fragmentation spectra and isotope distribution pattern were used to determine the elemental composition with Sirius2 software."
