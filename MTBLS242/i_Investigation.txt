Study Title	"Metabolomic fingerprint of severe obesity is dynamically affected by bariatric surgery in a procedure-dependent manner."
Study Description	"Obesity is associated with multiple diseases. Bariatric surgery is the most effective therapy for severe obesity that can reduce body weight and obesity-associated morbidity. The metabolic alterations associated with obesity and respective changes after bariatric surgery are incompletely understood.We comprehensively assessed metabolic alterations associated with severe obesity and distinct bariatric procedures. In our longitudinal observational study, we applied a (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance-based global, untargeted metabolomics strategy on human serum samples that were collected before and repeatedly <=1 y after distinct bariatric procedures [i.e., a sleeve gastrectomy, proximal Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and distal RYGB]. For comparison, we also analyzed serum samples from normal-weight and less-obese subjects who were matched for 1-y postoperative body mass index (BMI) values of the surgical groups. We identified a metabolomic fingerprint in obese subjects that was clearly discriminated from that of normal-weight subjects. Furthermore, we showed that bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomy and proximal and distal RYGB) dynamically affected this fingerprint in a procedure-dependent manner, thereby establishing new fingerprints that could be discriminated from those of BMI-matched and normal-weight control subjects. Metabolites that largely contributed to the metabolomic fingerprints of severe obesity were aromatic and branched-chain amino acids (elevated), metabolites related to energy metabolism (pyruvate and citrate; elevated), and metabolites suggested to be derived from gut microbiota (formate, methanol, and isopropanol; all elevated). Our data indicate that bariatric surgery, irrespective of the specific kind of procedure used, reverses most of the metabolic alterations associated with obesity and suggest profound changes in gut microbiome-host interactions after the surgery. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02480322."

Study Protocol Description	"Serum samples from 106 severely obese patients of the Interdisciplinary Obesity Center, St. Gallen, were collected before and 3, 6, 9, and 12 mth after bariatric surgery between May 2010 and May 2012. In addition, serum samples from 19 normal-weight volunteers and from 30 subjects with BMI that was matched to those achieved by the severely obese subjects 12 mo after the bariatric surgery were also collected. Each sample (total n = 465) was stored in the Da Vinci European Biobank (www.davincieuropeanbiobank.org) repository. A total of 19 patients underwent a sleeve gastrectomy, 27 patients underwent a proximal RYGB procedure, and 60 patients underwent a distal RYGB procedure
</p>
Serum samples, which were collected according to standardized clinical procedures (i.e. drawn in the morning after an overnight fast), were frozen at -80 °C and shipped in dry ice to the metabolomic laboratory. Samples received from St. Gallen were stored at -80 °C until the NMR analysis. Frozen serum samples were thawed at room temperature and shaken before use."	"None."	"A total of 300 µl sodium phosphate buffer [70 mM Na2HPO4/l; 20% (v:v) 2 H2O; 0.025% (v:v) NaN3; and 0.8% (w:v) sodium trimethylsilyl (2,2,3,3-2H4)propionate; pH 7.4] was added to 300 µl of each plasma sample, and the mixture was homogenized on a vortex for 30 s. A total of 450 µl of this mixture was transferred into a 4.25-mm NMR tube (Bruker BioSpin srl) for analysis."	"NMR spectra for all samples were acquired with the use of a Bruker spectrometer (Bruker Biospin srl) operating at 14.1 T (600.13-MHz proton Larmor frequency) equipped with a triple resonance inverse cryo probe cryoprobe, an automatic tuning matching unit, and an automatic sample changer."	"Car-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence spectra (that contained signals arising mostly from low–molecular mass metabolites), diffusion-edited spectra (that contain signals arising mostly from macromolecules), and one-dimensional-nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra (that contain both kinds of signals) were measured."	"For each spectrum, the region between 6.0 and 4.5 ppm, which contained the residual water signal, was removed from the subsequent analysis. Each 1-dimensional spectrum in the range between 0.2 and 10.0 ppm was segmented into 0.02-ppm chemical shift buckets, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated with the use of AMIX software (version 3.8.4; Bruker BioSpin), which gave a total of 466 variables. Spectra were used without normalization."	"A total of 30 metabolites were identified as follows—amino acids: alanine, arginine, glutamine, glycine, histidine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine; carboxylic acid anions: acetate, acetoacetate, citrate, formate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, and pyruvate; other metabolites: creatine, creatinine, dimethyl sulfone, glucose, hypoxanthine, isopropanol, methanol, propanol, lipoproteins, LDL1, VLDL1, trimethylamine-N oxide (TMAO), and urea. Of these, 24 metabolites showed variations in the patients over the postsurgical course.
</p>
All resonances of interest were manually checked, and signals were assigned on template 1-dimensional NMR profiles with the use of matching routines of AMIX 7.3.2 software (Bruker BioSpin) in combination with the BBIOREFCODE version 2–0-0 reference database and published literature when available. For the identification of new signals belonging to DMSO2, 2-dimensional NMR experiments and the spiking of reference compounds were done. All calculations were made with the use of scripts written in our laboratory with the use of the R language version: 3.0.2"
