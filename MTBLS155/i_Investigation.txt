Study Title	"Release of Ecologically Relevant Metabolites by the Cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus CCMP 1631"
Study Description	"Phytoplankton are known to release organic compounds that fuel secondary production by heterotrophic bacteria. Here we show that an abundant marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus, contributes a variety of nitrogen-rich and sulfur-containing compounds to dissolved organic matter. A combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomics and genomic tools was used to characterize the intracellular and extracellular metabolites of S. elongatus. Aromatic compounds such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and phenylalanine, as well as nucleosides (e.g., thymidine, 5’-methylthioadenosine, xanthosine), the organosulfur compound 3-mercaptopropionate, and the plant auxin indole 3-acetic acid, were detected in the extracellular metabolites at multiple time points during the growth of S. elongatus. Further, the amino acid kynurenine was found to accumulate in the media even though it was not included in the predicted metabolome of S. elongatus. This suggests that not all metabolites produced by an organism can be predicted from its genome sequence. Some metabolites may be products of non-enzymatic reactions and are likely excreted into the environment as waste. The compounds described herein provide excellent targets for quantitative analysis in field settings to assess the source and lability of dissolved organic matter in situ."

Study Protocol Description	"Synechococcus elongatus CCMP 1631 was purchased from the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (Boothbay, ME, USA) and grown in 300 ml of L1-Si media (https://ncma.bigelow.org/algal-recipes) using Turks Island Salts as a base.  A starter culture in exponential phase was used to inoculate 12 flasks of media with 10% of the volume (30 ml).  Another six flasks contained only the media as cell-free  controls.  The cultures were maintained at room temperature under a 12:12 light:dark regime (56 μmol/m2/s) and were sampled at approximately 30 min into the light cycle, at each time point.  Cultures were grown for three weeks and samples were taken on days: 0, 2, 8, 10, 15, and 17.  Cells were captured by gentle vacuum filtration on 0.2 µm Omnipore (Millipore) filters. The filtrate was acidified to a pH=3 and extracted immediately. The filters were stored at  80 ºC until extraction could occur in one batch for the entire experiment. "	"The intracellular metabolites were extracted using a method modified from a protocol described by [1]. Briefly, the filter was extracted three times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and dried in a vacufuge. 
</p>
The samples for the targeted mass spectrometry analysis were re-dissolved in 90:10 (v/v) water:acetonitrile and combined with deuterated biotin (final concentration 0.05 µg/ml) as an internal standard.
</p>
For untargeted analysis, the extracts had to undergo an additional de-salting step prior to analysis. Therefore, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and extracted using a 50 mg/1 cc PPL cartridge following the protocol of [2]. The resulting methanol extracts were re-dissolved in 95:5 water:acetonitrile.
</p>
The filtrate for each sample, representing the extracellular metabolite fraction, was processed using SPE as described above (following [1]) but with 1 g/6 cc cartridges. The extracellular metabolite extract was redissolved in 500 µl of 95:5 water:acetonitrile for both targeted and untargeted metabolomics analysis.

The chromatography gradient was: an initial hold of 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water) : 5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 2 minutes, ramp to 65% B from 2 to 20 minutes, ramp to 100% B from 20 to 25 min, and hold until 32.5 minutes. The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min between samples with solvent A. Each metabolite was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with optimal parameters determined from infusion of authentic standards. Eight-point external calibration curves (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng/ml) were generated for each compound by plotting peak area against concentration. 
</p>
For untargeted metabolomics analysis, LC separation was performed using a Synergi Fusion reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with the same gradient as for targeted analysis."	"For targeted analysis, samples were analyzed with a Thermo Scientific TSQ Vantage Triple Stage Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. This instrument allows polarity switching between positive and negative ion mode within a single LC run. Analysis of authentic standards was used to determine the optimal ionization mode for each metabolite.
</p>
For untargeted analysis, samples were analyzed in both negative and positive ion mode with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled by electrospray ionization to a 7-Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). In parallel to the FT acquisition, four data dependent MS/MS scans were collected at nominal mass resolution in the ion trap (LTQ). Samples were analyzed in random order with a pooled sampled run every six samples in order to assess instrument variability."	"Targeted metabolomics data were analyzed using XCalibur 2.0. The concentration of the metabolites in the targeted mass spectrometry data is given in ng/ml. Untargeted metabolomics data were collected as XCalibur RAW files which were converted to mzXML files using the msConvert tool within ProteoWizard [1]. Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS [2], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm [3], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps. CAMERA [4] was used to extract the intensities and m/z values for the associated MS/MS spectra.

Mass features of interest with an associated fragmentation spectrum were processed using the xcmsFragment function in XCMS and the spectra were queried against the METLIN metabolomics database [1] and in the program MetFrag [2].  Putative identifications were confirmed, where possible, with commercial standards analyzed by our methods (i.e. kynurenine, tryptophan).
</p>
The targeted metabolomics compound identifications were based on measurements of authentic standards on the same mass spectrometer. Note that the LC/mass spectrometry system cannot distinguish between leucine and isoleucine, therefore the data are presented as 'leucine/isoleucine'. Similiarly, threonine and homeserine are not analytically distinct and are presented as 'threonine/homoserine'.
