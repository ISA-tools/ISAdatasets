                    the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer instruction. Assays
                    were carried out using 10 ?l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 ?l in black,
                    96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on Perkin Elmer Victor Plate reader using the
                    485/530 nm excitation/emission filter pair with measurement time 0.1 second. Following quantitation,
                    cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was
                    precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following the addition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration)
                    and two volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 g for 40
                    minutes at 4?C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and
                    centrifuged again at 7,800 g for 20 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was
                    air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 ?l of nuclease-free water
                    (Ambion). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop
                    spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life
                    Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche) following the Titanium chemistry.

                    the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer instruction. Assays
                    were carried out using 10 ?l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 ?l in black,
                    96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on Perkin Elmer Victor Plate reader using the
                    485/530 nm excitation/emission filter pair with measurement time 0.1 second. Following quantitation,
                    cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was
                    precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following the addition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration)
                    and two volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 g for 40
                    minutes at 4?C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and
                    centrifuged again at 7,800 g for 20 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was
                    air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 ?l of nuclease-free water
                    (Ambion). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop
                    spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life
                    Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche) following the Titanium chemistry.

                <LIBRARY_CONSTRUCTION_PROTOCOL>protocol_description: Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using
                    the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer instruction. Assays
                    were carried out using 10 ?l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 ?l in black,
                    96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on Perkin Elmer Victor Plate reader using the
                    485/530 nm excitation/emission filter pair with measurement time 0.1 second. Following quantitation,
                    cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was
                    precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following the addition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration)
                    and two volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 g for 40
                    minutes at 4?C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and
                    centrifuged again at 7,800 g for 20 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was
                    air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 ?l of nuclease-free water
                    (Ambion). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop
                    spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life
                    Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche) following the Titanium chemistry.

                    the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer instruction. Assays
                    were carried out using 10 ?l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 ?l in black,
                    96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on Perkin Elmer Victor Plate reader using the
                    485/530 nm excitation/emission filter pair with measurement time 0.1 second. Following quantitation,
                    cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was
                    precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following the addition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration)
                    and two volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 g for 40
                    minutes at 4?C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and
                    centrifuged again at 7,800 g for 20 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was
                    air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 ?l of nuclease-free water
                    (Ambion). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop
                    spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life
                    Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche) following the Titanium chemistry.

                    the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer instruction. Assays
                    were carried out using 10 ?l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 ?l in black,
                    96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on Perkin Elmer Victor Plate reader using the
                    485/530 nm excitation/emission filter pair with measurement time 0.1 second. Following quantitation,
                    cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was
                    precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following the addition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration)
                    and two volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 g for 40
                    minutes at 4?C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and
                    centrifuged again at 7,800 g for 20 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was
                    air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 ?l of nuclease-free water
                    (Ambion). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop
                    spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life
                    Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche) following the Titanium chemistry.

                    the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer instruction. Assays
                    were carried out using 10 ?l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 ?l in black,
                    96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on Perkin Elmer Victor Plate reader using the
                    485/530 nm excitation/emission filter pair with measurement time 0.1 second. Following quantitation,
                    cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was
                    precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following the addition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration)
                    and two volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 g for 40
                    minutes at 4?C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and
                    centrifuged again at 7,800 g for 20 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was
                    air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 ?l of nuclease-free water
                    (Ambion). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop
                    spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life
                    Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche) following the Titanium chemistry.

                    the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer instruction. Assays
                    were carried out using 10 ?l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 ?l in black,
                    96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on Perkin Elmer Victor Plate reader using the
                    485/530 nm excitation/emission filter pair with measurement time 0.1 second. Following quantitation,
                    cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was
                    precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following the addition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration)
                    and two volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 g for 40
                    minutes at 4?C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and
                    centrifuged again at 7,800 g for 20 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was
                    air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 ?l of nuclease-free water
                    (Ambion). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop
                    spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life
                    Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche) following the Titanium chemistry.

                    the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer instruction. Assays
                    were carried out using 10 ?l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 ?l in black,
                    96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on Perkin Elmer Victor Plate reader using the
                    485/530 nm excitation/emission filter pair with measurement time 0.1 second. Following quantitation,
                    cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was
                    precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following the addition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration)
                    and two volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 g for 40
                    minutes at 4?C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and
                    centrifuged again at 7,800 g for 20 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was
                    air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 ?l of nuclease-free water
                    (Ambion). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop
                    spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life
                    Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche) following the Titanium chemistry.

                    were carried out using 10 ?l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 ?l in black,
                    96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on Perkin Elmer Victor Plate reader using the
                    485/530 nm excitation/emission filter pair with measurement time 0.1 second. Following quantitation,
                    cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was
                    precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following the addition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration)
                    and two volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 g for 40
                    minutes at 4?C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and
                    centrifuged again at 7,800 g for 20 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was
                    air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 ?l of nuclease-free water
                    (Ambion). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop
                    spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life
                    Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche) following the Titanium chemistry.
