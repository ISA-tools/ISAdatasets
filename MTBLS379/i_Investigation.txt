STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS379"
Study Title	"Brain metabolomic profiling of eastern honey bee (Apis cerana) infested with the mite Varroa destructor."
Study Description	"The mite Varroa destructor is currently the greatest threat to apiculture as it is causing a global decrease in honey bee colonies. However, it rarely causes serious damage to its native hosts, the eastern honey bees Apis cerana. To better understand the mechanism of resistance of A. cerana against the V. destructor mite, we profiled the metabolic changes that occur in the honey bee brain during V. destructor infestation. Brain samples were collected from infested and control honey bees and then measured using an untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based global metabolomics method, in which 7918 and 7462 ions in ESI+ and ESI- mode, respectively, were successfully identified. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied, and 64 dysregulated metabolites, including fatty acids, amino acids, carboxylic acid, and phospholipids, amongst others, were identified. Pathway analysis further revealed that linoleic acid metabolism; propanoate metabolism; and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were acutely perturbed. The data obtained in this study offer insight into the defense mechanisms of A. cerana against V. destructor mites and provide a better method for understanding the synergistic effects of parasitism on honey bee colonies."

Study Protocol Description	"Samples of Apis cerana were introduced into a cage and anaesthetized with CO2, then immediately inoculated with mites (Varroa destructor). When a bee appeared to have fully recovered, by displaying target behaviour such as grooming behaviour for 5 mins, then the bee was sacrificed by flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Under a dissection microscope, bee brains were dissected on dry ice and then stored at -80 °C."	"A total of 25 mg of brain samples was homogenized in 80 µl of a precooled methanol/water (1:1) solvent and ground for 5 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant (200 µl) was transferred to a new 1.5 ml polypropylene tube and processed through vacuum freeze drying before liquid chromatography separation."	"Liquid chromatography was performed on a 2777C UPLC system (Waters, UK). The separation of all samples was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (Waters, UK) (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm). A gradient elution program was run for chromatographic separation with mobile phase A (water), and mobile phase B (acetonitrile) as follows: 0~2 min, 100% A-100% A; 2~12 min, 100% A-0% A; 12~14 min, 0% A-0% A; and 14~15 min, 0% A-100% A. The injection volume was 10 µl, and the flow rate was set to 0.4 ml/min."	"
A SYNAPT G2 XS QTOF (Waters, U.K.) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used for mass spectrometric detection. Sample analyses were performed in both positive and negative ion modes. The operating parameters were as follows: capillary, 0.3 kV (ESI+) or 2 kV (ESI-); sampling cone, 40 V; source temperature, 120 °C (ESI+) or 100 °C (ESI-); desolvation temperature, 500 °C (ESI+) or 350 °C (ESI-); desolvation gas, 800 (l/h); cone gas, 50 (l/h); source offset, 80; TOF acquisition mode, sensitivity (ESI+) or sensitivity (ESI-); acquisition method, continuum MSE; TOF mass range, 50–1200 Da; scan time: 0.1 s; and collision energy function 2, trap CE ramp 20–40 eV.  During the acquisition, the LE signal was acquired every 3 s to calibrate the mass accuracy. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the stability of the LC-MS during the whole acquisition, a quality control sample (pool of all samples) was acquired after every 10 samples."	"Raw data files were uploaded into Progenesis QI software (version 2.1), within which data alignment, normalization, and peak picking were performed."	"The data matrix was mean-centered, pareto-scaled, and analyzed by both principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The quality of the models was evaluated with the relevant R2 and Q2 as described elsewhere[1]. Meanwhile, permutation tests (1000 cycles) were conducted to assess the robustness of the PLS-DA model. Differential metabolites were selected when the statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values obtained from the PLS-DA model was larger than 1.0. Meanwhile, differences were tested with a Student’s t-test, and a corrected p–value (q-value) < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Log2 fold change (FC) was used to show how these selected differential metabolites varied between groups. A heat map was generated using the MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) v.4.9 software (http://www.tm4.org/mev.html) based on the abundance of differentially expressed metabolite data (log2-scaled)[2]. To check and confirm the putative differentially expressed metabolites, the HMDB and KEGG databases were used[3][4]. Candidate metabolites were confirmed by MS/MS scans for the characteristic ions and fragmentation patterns of the compound. A pathway analysis of the differentially expressed metabolites was performed based on the HMDB and KEGG databases.
