Study Identifier	"MTBLS259"
Study Title	"Metabolomics reveals an involvement of pantothenate for male production responding to the short-day stimulus in the water flea, Daphnia pulex"
Study Description	"Under favorable conditions, the micro-crustacean Daphnia pulex produces female offspring by parthenogenesis, whereas in response to various unfavorable external cues, they produce male offspring to induce sexual reproduction (environmental sex determination: ESD). We recently established a suitable experimental system for ESD studies using D. pulex WTN6 strain, in which the sex of the offspring can be regulated simply by alterations in day-length; long-day and short-day conditions can induce female and male offspring respectively. Taking advantage of this system, we have already demonstrated that methyl farnesoate (MF) synthesis is necessary for male offspring production. Further, we identified ionotropic glutamate receptors as an upstream regulator of MF signaling by transcriptome analysis. Despite these findings, the molecular mechanisms associated with MF signaling have not yet been well elucidated in D. pulex. To more comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms of ESD, we analyzed the whole metabolic profiles of mother daphniids reared under long-day (female-producing) and short-day (male-producing) conditions using mass spectrometry based metabolomics. We discovered that pantothenate (vitamin B5), a known precursor to coenzyme A, was significantly accumulated in response to the short-day condition. To confirm the role of pantothenate in D. pulex ESD, this metabolite was administered to mother daphniids (under long-day conditions) resulting in a significantly increased proportion of male offspring producing mothers. This study not only provides several candidates for further investigations into the molecular changes involved in male offspring production, but also novel insights into the metabolic mechanisms of the ESD system in D. pulex."

Study Protocol Description	"The D. pulex WTN6 strain was obtained from the Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics (Indiana University, USA). Animals were maintained in dechlorinated freshwater, which was aerated and filtered through activated carbon for two weeks, at 18 °C. The water hardness and dissolved oxygen concentration were 60 mg/l (as CaCO3) and 91.5% as measured by chelatometric titration (Kyoritsu Chemical-check Lab., Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and a dissolved oxygen meter (SevenGo pro SG9, Mettler-Toledo, LLC., Ohio, USA), respectively. A 0.04 ml suspension of 4.3 x 108 cells/ml Chlorella vulgaris was added daily to each culture of 40 individual daphniids in 2l beakers as a food source. The WTN6 strain was selected for this study as it is possible to induce the production of female or male offspring by rearing under 14 h light:10 h dark or 10 h light:14 h dark conditions, respectively [1]. Each individual daphniid was cultured in 50 ml of freshwater under the long-day or short-day conditions, and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen during the critical period for sex determination (50 hours after ovulation) at one month of age (i.e. after ovulating at least 8 times). Three individual animals were combined to form sufficient biomass for one biological replicate, and ten experiments were conducted independently yielding ten biological replicates for each of the two conditions.</br>

Briefly, each frozen sample was homogenized using a Precellys-24 ceramic bead-based homogenizer (Stretton Scientific Ltd., UK) in 448 μl of a 5:2 mixture of methanol: water (both high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] grade). Homogenate was then transferred into a 1.8 ml glass vial and further volumes of water (160 µl) and chloroform (320 μl) were added to yield a final solvent ratio of 2:2:1.8 methanol: chloroform: water. This mixture was vortex-mixed and centrifuged (4000 x g rcf, 10 min) yielding a biphasic separation. The upper, polar layer of each sample was split evenly (approximately 180 µl per aliquot) into two 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes for separate mass spectrometric analyses in positive and negative ion modes. The lower, non-polar layer was not used in this study. Polar extracts were dried using a centrifugal concentrator (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY, USA) and stored at -80 °C prior to DIMS analysis. Two “extract blanks” were created using the above homogenization and extraction protocols in the absence of biological material.</br>

"	"N/A"	"Immediately prior to analysis, polar extracts were removed from storage at -80 °C and resuspended for Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) DIMS analysis. One extract per sample was resuspended in 60 µl 4:1 methanol:water with 20 mM ammonium acetate for negative ion analysis, while the other was resuspended in 60 µl 4:1 methanol:water containing 0.25% formic acid for positive ion analysis. Resuspended samples were centrifuged (22,000 x g rcf, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove particulate matter. The supernatant of each sample was then loaded as four adjacent technical replicates (5 µl per well) onto a 384 well plate (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in a random order. From the remaining supernatant of each sample, 15 µl were removed and pooled to generate a quality control sample (QC).
</p>
All D. pulex samples were analyzed in both ion modes using an LTQ FT Ultra FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a direct infusion, chip-based nanoelectrospray ionization source (Triversa, Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY, USA). Data was acquired from m/z 70-590 using the selected ion monitoring (SIM) stitching methodology [1] in seven SIM windows of 100 m/z width and 30 m/z overlap. Samples were analyzed as quadruplicate technical replicates with QC samples spaced evenly throughout the analysis to allow any drift in the DIMS signal intensities to be distinguished from genuine biological differences.</br>

The resulting filtered matrices (one per ion mode) were probabilistic quotient normalized (PQN) [3] and missing values were imputed using the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm [4]. The resulting matrices were analysed using univariate statistics, and were transformed using the generalized logarithm [5] prior to multivariate statistical analysis. All spectral processing was conducted using in-house scripts in Matlab (version 7, The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).</br>

"	"Putative empirical formula(e) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) compound names were assigned, where possible, to the significantly changing m/z peaks using the transformation mapping algorithm in the Metabolite Identification Package (MI-Pack) [1]. Briefly, MI-Pack calculates accurate m/z values for common negative ions ([M-H]−, [M + 35Cl]−, [M + 37Cl]−, [M + Acetate(Ac)]−, [M + K-2H]− and [M + Na-2H]−) and positive ions ([M + H]+, [M + Na]+, [M + 39K]+, [M + 41K]+) of all compounds within the KEGG compounds database. It then attempts to match these m/z values with the accurate masses measured in the mass spectra, within a mass error window of 1 ppm. The transformation mapping algorithm [1] was used to increase confidence in the assigned putative metabolite names. The resulting list of significantly changing KEGG compound IDs was input into MetaboAnalyst [2] and Fisher’s exact test was used for over-representation analysis against a background list of all putatively annotated KEGG compound IDs [3].</br>
