Study Title	"Mining for metabolic responses to long-term salt stress: a case study on Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (B)"
Study Description	"New metabolic profiling technologies provide data on a wider range of metabolites than traditional targeted approaches. Metabolomic technologies currently facilitate acquisition of multivariate metabolic data using diverse, mostly hyphenated, chromatographic detection systems, such as GC-MS or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy or NMR-based methods. Analysis of the resulting data can be performed through a combination of non-supervised and supervised statistical methods, such as independent component analysis and analysis of variance, respectively. These methods reduce the complex data sets to information, which is relevant for the discovery of metabolic markers or for hypothesis-driven, pathway-based analysis. Plant responses to salinity involve changes in the activity of genes and proteins, which invariably lead to changes in plant metabolism. Here, we highlight a selection of recent publications in the salt stress field, and use gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiles of polar fractions from the plant models, Arabidopsis thaliana, Lotus japonicus and Oryza sativa to demonstrate the power of metabolite profiling. We present evidence for conserved and divergent metabolic responses among these three species and conclude that a change in the balance between amino acids and organic acids may be a conserved metabolic response of plants to salt stress."

Study Protocol Description	"The metabolic profiling of A. thaliana was obtained from experiments carried out in soil under greenhouse conditions, following a gradual step-wise salt acclimation approach [1]. Seeds of A. thaliana were directly sown in soil, “Einheits-Erde” type 0, using 10 cm pots. Plants were irrigated with half-strength Hoagland’s nutrient solution. Salt treatment was for 20 days and started four days post-imbibition. Four days after imbibition, germinated plants were transplanted to soil and irrigated with the above nutrient solution. Salt treatment started eight days post-imbibition and samples were taken after 24 days. The salt content of the nutrient solution was increased in steps, 10, 25, 50 and 75 NaCl mM. Time of each step was 4 days. A subset of plants was kept at each final salt level until harvest. Details of plant growth and salt acclimation have been reported previously [2].

Peak height representing arbitrary mass spectral ion currents of each mass fragment was normalized using the amount of the sample fresh weight and ribitol for internal standardization of volume variations. Normalized responses and subsequently response ratios were calculated comparing to the global median of all samples as described [1]. Resulting response ratios were log10 transformed prior to statistical analysis. Principal (PCA) and independent (ICA) component analyses were performed through the MetaGenAlyse web service, http://metagenealyse.mpimp-golm.mpg.de. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was calculated by the Multiple Experiment Viewer package, (MEV version 4.0.01, http://www.tm4.org/mev.html).
